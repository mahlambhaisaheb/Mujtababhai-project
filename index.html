After the martyrdom of the legatee of Prophet Mohammad Rasoolullaah, Ameer ul-Mumineen Maulaana 'Ali in 40 AH, his son Hasan al-Mujtabaa became the first Imam and this institution of Imamat i.e. succession of al-A'immat al-Faatemiyeen continued from father to son till the 21st Imam. This 21st Fatimid Imam at-Taiyeb Abul Qaasim went into seclusion from Egypt in 528 AH, in Yemen under the guidance of Hujjat-e-Imam Saiyedah Hurrah Malekah Arwaa bint Ahmad from 532 AH, one Da'i succeeded another through the tradition of Nass - the exclusive spiritual appointment, until the 23rd Da'i i.e. from 1st Da'i Saiyedna Zoeb bin Saiyedi Moosa till 23rd Da'i Saiyedna Mohammad Izzuddin. In Sindh and India too Wulaat ul-Hind were appointed by these Du'aat one after another until Wali-ul-Hind Maulaai Ja'far, Maulaai 'Abd ul Wahab and Maulaai Qaasim Khan bin Hasan (11th and last Wali-ul-Hind, d. 950AH, Ahmedabad). The last three walis were of great help in the era of the 21st to 24th Da'i i.e. Saiyedna Husaamuddin (921-932 AH), Saiyedna Shamsuddin (933 AH), Saiyedna Izzuddin (933-946 AH) and Saiyedna Najmuddin (946-974 AH). It was during this time when the seat of Da'wat e Haadiyah was transferred to India from Yemen, the 23rd Da'i ul-Mutlaq Mohammed Izzuddin performed Nass (transfer of authority) on Yusuf Najmuddin bin Saiyedi Sulaiman in Sidhpur, Gujarat, India.
Due to constant harassment and persecution by the local Zaydi Shi'a ruler in Yemen, the 24th Da'i, Yusuf Najmuddin bin Saiyedi Sulayman (d. 1567 AD), shifted the whole administration of the Da'wat e Haadiyah (rightly guided mission) to India but continued to live in Yemen in the last years of his tenure and died there in Taibah. The 25th Da'i Jalaal Shamsuddin (d. 1567 AD) was first Da'i to die in India and he was torch-bearer in establishing the representation of the Imam of the Time from the progeny of Mohammad Rasoolullaah though he stayed for only 4 months on the Seat of Da'wat; his mausoleum is in Ahmedabad, India. As mentioned his tenure as a Da'i ul-Mutlaq was very short but he played a pivotal role as one of the most trusted person from Hudood and as a Mazoon during the period of 23rd and 24th Da'i.
Following the death of the 26th Da'i Saiyedna Dawoodji Burhaanuddin bin Saiyedi Ajabshah in 997 AH/1591 AD in Ahmedabad, there was a dispute as to who was to succeed him. Sulaiman bin Hasan, the grandson of 24th Da'i, was the then Wali in Yemen and claimed the succession, supported by other Yemeni Bohra groups. However, the Indian Bohras denied his claim of Nass, declaring supporting documentation to be forged and doctored. The two factions separated, with the followers of Sulaiman becoming the Sulaimanis, and the followers of 27th Da'i Saiyedna Dawoodji Burhaanuddin bin Saiyedi Qutubshah becoming Dawoodi Bohras.
After the death of the 28th Da'i, Saiyedna Sheikh Aadam Safiyuddin, in 1030 AH/1621 AD, a small noble devoted faction of Alavi Bohras in Ahmedabad recognized his grandson Saiyedna 'Ali bin Saiyedi Ibraahim (d. 1046 AH/ 1637 AD), the great martyr, who was Mazoon, Mansoos and treasurer of Kutub e Da'wat, as his successor and got separated in 1030 AH from the majority Dawoodi Bohra who believed in 'Abd ut Taiyeb Zakiyuddin. From then onwards, Alavi Bohras followed a separate line of Du'aat residing mainly in Vadodara (Gujarat, India) where they have their own locality. Saiyedna 'Ali was supported by his uncle and his Mansoos Saiyedna Taiyeb Zakiyuddin (d. 1047 AH/1638 AD) with the loyalty of very few staunch followers. Saiyedna 'Ali never carried his protest to the court of Mughal Emperor Jahangir to declare him as a legitimate Da'i. Unverified accounts of this episode could be found in many publications. But Saiyedna 'Ali ordered his associate Mukaasir Hasan Badruddin in 1031 AH/1622 AD to go to the Mughal court in Lahore to meet Jahangir to complain on his behalf about the atrocities meted upon Alavis in Ahmedabad by their opponents. The help came and the lives of Alavis became better than before. This relief was short-lived and again the harassment sprung up more fiercely. Mukaasir Hasan Badruddin went again to Lahore for the same reason and then traveled to Kashmir to meet Emperor Shah Jahan in 1046 AH/1637 AD, the year of the martyrdom of Saiyedna 'Ali. Hasan Badruddin was not present at the time of the burial of Saiyedna 'Ali.
Saiyedna 'Ali, the 29th Alavi Da'i was born in the walled city of Vadodara in Fakhri Mohalla, when 27th Da'i Saiyedna Dawoodji Burhaanuddin bin Saiyedi Qutubshah was alive in Ahmedabad. His father Saiyedi Ibrahim died during his childhood. He became Haafiz ul-Qur'an in a tender age and when his grandfather 28th Da'i Saiyedna Shaikh Aadam brought him to Ahmedabad for further studies in Uloom-e-Da'wat in the majlis of 27th Da'i, by seeing face of Saiyedna 'Ali, 27th Da'i gave glad-tidings to 28th Da'i that, "This son will become the Light of your Eyes, so educate him as he is going to become the man of great acclaim."

	Short note on the Origin of Alavi Bohras and its Bohraism: PDF<br><br>
	
	Alavi Bohras are the Muslim-Shi'a-Isma'ili-Musta'alavi-Taiyebi community whose origin and spiritual ancestry is established and associated to the Five Spiritual Masters of Purity (Khamsat ul-Athaar or Panjatan Paak) which includes Mohammad Rasoolullaah (saws) – the Master of the Prophets (Saiyed ul-Ambiyaa); Ali ul-Murtazaa (as) – the Master of Vicegerents (Saiyed ul-Waseeyin), the vicegerent, cousin and son-in-law of Rasoolullaah (saws); Faatemat uz-Zahraa (as) – the Master of the Women of all times (Saiyadah Nisaa il-Aalameen) and the daughter of Rasoolullaah (saws); Imaam Hasan (as) and Imaam Husain (as) – the Truthful Imaams (Imaama Haqqin) and the grandson of Rasoolullaah (saws) and the sons of Ali and Faatemah. After the vicegerency of Ali ul-Murtazaa (as), Imaam Hasan became the first imaam followed by his brother Imaam Husain who came second and then the succession took place in the descendants (aal) of Imaam Husain from father to son called Infallible Imaams (A'immat ul-Maa’sumeen) whose succession will continue till The Last Day (qayaamat).
Alavi Bohras are Isma'ilis because of the fact that they adhered to the spiritual succession (Imaamat) of the 6th Faatemi Imaam Isma'il, the son of the 5th Imaam Ja'far us-Saadiq (as) when the split occurred in the mainstream Shi'a resulting in Isma'ilis and Isnaa-Asharis. Alavi Bohras are Musta'alavis because during the reign of the 18th Faatemi imaam, Mustansir billah (as) (427-487 AH/1036-1094 AD), schism occurred in the mainstream Isma'ilis in Egypt, those who believed in the spiritual succession of 19th Faatemi Imaam Musta'ali, the son of Mustansir billah (as) came to be known as Musta'alavis. Their 21st Faatemi Imaam Taiyeb (as), the son of 20th Faatemi Imaam Aamir (as), went into seclusion (satr) from Egypt after 526 AH/1132 AD owing to growing fear from the enemies. They believe that the succession of Taiyebi Imaams (as), though in seclusion, will always continue in the progeny of Imaam Taiyeb (as) till the Day of Judgement, thus Alavi Bohras are called Taiyebis. The sole spiritual, religious and temporal authority after the seclusion of Imaam (as) got transformed in Yaman in 532 AH/1138 AD in the form of a missionary  (da’i) who owed the allegiance of the believers to the noble progeny of Imaam Taiyeb (as). They continued their mission in Yaman in the name of Imaam of their time (imaam uz-zamaan). The succession of these missionaries is called as Du’aat-e-Mutlaqeen (Pl. of Da’i-e-Mutlaq).
In India, during the time of 18th Faatemi Imaam Mustansir billaah (as) around 486 AH/1093 AD, the designated learned people (wulaat) who were sent from Yaman by the celebrated missionaries (du’aat ul-balaagh) under the guidance of the manifest Imaam (as opposed to the imaam of the time of seclusion) established the foundation of Isma’ili-Taiyebi Da’wat in the region of Gujarat (Cambay or Khambhat). It was the result of their perseverance and efforts that people started believing and accepting the Isma’ili-Taiyebi principles and gradually the mission of Yaman gave birth to a new community in India – The Bohras.  The succession of those designated learned people who worked as deputies of the missionaries of Yaman came to be known as Wulaat ul-Hind in India. They were all in close contact with the spiritual authority of Yaman i.e. the Da’i-e-Mutlaq after the seclusion of the Imaam Taiyeb (as).
Subsequently, split occurred at various instances in the mainstream Bohra community regarding the spiritual appointment (Nass) in the succession of Da’i-e-Mutlaq in Gujarat (Ahmedabad) between 825-1050 AH/1422-1640 AD. Two major splits during this period resulted in the formation of three major groups of Bohra community – Alavis, Dawoodis and Sulaymaanis. The tradition (sunnat) of the manifestation and the appointment of a Da’i-e-Mutlaq known as the Propagation of “Nass” is solely carried out by a former Da’i himself.  Among Bohras, Alavis are the smallest minority who has independently survived all the vicissitudes of time. They believe in the Qur’anic Verse that, “On the path of truth, minority always win.”
Alavi Bohras, who are mainly traders, are peace-loving and harmonious people. The word ‘bohra or vohra or Vohorwu or Vyavahar' itself indicates maintaining relations and is derived from the Gujarati word ‘vohorvu’ or ‘vyavahar’, which means "to trade". Secondly its name reflects the characteristic of "al-Jamaa'at ul-Baaherah" meaning the extraordinary brilliant community with full of life and love. Their cultural and social upbringing is such that the values of peace and prosperity are in their blood and they do not believe in social discord or religious conflicts. Some of the groups or clans of Sunnis in Gujarat who also are traders and do not belong to the mainstream Bohras have adopted the name of Vohra or Vora, owing to the fame and respect of the name. But they never followed the basic doctrines and customs of the Isma'ili-Taiyebi Bohras. The early Indian converts of the 11th century AD during the reign of 18th Faatemi Imaam Mustansir (as) comprised a single group of Isma'ili Bohras owing allegiance to the missionaries (du'aat ul-balaagh) who conveyed spiritual orders of manifest Imaam (imaam-e-zaahir) to common believers in Yaman.

Alavi Origin (pdf)
In India, during the time of 18th Faatemi Imaam Mustansir billaah (as) around 486 AH/1093 AD, the designated learned people (wulaat) who were sent from Yaman by the celebrated missionaries (du’aat ul-balaagh) under the guidance of the manifest Imaam (as opposed to the imaam of the time of seclusion) established the foundation of Isma’ili-Taiyebi Da’wat in the region of Gujarat (Cambay or Khambhat). It was the result of their perseverance and efforts that people started believing and accepting the Isma’ili-Taiyebi principles and gradually the mission of Yaman gave birth to a new community in India – The Bohras. The succession of those designated learned people who worked as deputies of the missionaries of Yaman came to be known as Wulaat ul-Hind in India.

	How the Mission (Da’wat) works

    <br><br>

	
	al-Hayaao Sho'batun minal Imaan: The Shame is the part of the Faith
	
	The religious hierarchy as well as social-cultural setup of the Alavi Bohras is essentially and traditionally Faatimid and the whole community is headed and governed by the chief authority of Da’i-e-Mutlaq who is appointed by his predecessor in office. The Da'i appoints two others to the subsidiary ranks of Ma’zoon (licentiate) and Mukaasir (executor).  Ma’zoon (licentiate) means the person on the status of ‘izn’, one who takes oath and calls his subjects into the folds of Isma’ili faith. Mukaasir (executor) means the person on the status of ‘kasr’, one who is well versed with the false faiths of other sects and he removes doubts of his subjects by furnishing appropriate proofs of the truth.  These positions are followed by the rank of Ra's ul-Hudood, Hadd-saheb, Miya-saheb, Shaikh-saheb and Mulla-saheb, who are appointed by Da’i-e-Mutlaq to perform varied Da’wat duties as per his learning, capability, efficiency and merits.  Apart from all lower positions of different ranks (sahebs), the post of Ra's ul-Hudood is occupied by a highly educated and influential person who implements strict discipline in his subordinates and takes accounts of the execution of responsibilities from his lower ranks and reports the same to his upper ones.
The residence of the Da’i-e-Mutlaq is named as ‘Devdi Mubaarak’ or ‘Markaz-e-Da’wat’ i.e. the centre of the mission.  All the spiritual activities (ruhaani umoor) of the followers right from his birth till his death is executed from this centre like the ceremony of giving names to a new-born, taking oath of allegiance from an adolescent boy/girl after giving him required preliminary religious knowledge, taking lectures on theology and spirituality among selected followers, conducting Nikaah, carrying out Talaaq proceedings, settling internal and family disputes, arranging for burial rites, seeing the bad-good omen (fa’l)through Qur’an, fixing of engagement (nisbat) between prospective boys and girls etc.  Near the centre, there is the Main Mosque (al-Masjid ul-Jaame’) where Da’i or Ma’zoon leads the daily prayers (namaaz), Friday prayer, prayer of the first night of every Islaamic month, prayer of the midnight (nisf ul-layl) in Ramazaan, prayer of important days-nights, prayer of Eid, prayer of the deceased (janaazah) etc.  Today, the centre of Alavi Bohras is Vadodara where Da’i resides and apart from the Main Mosque there are other mosques and community halls which are looked after by Da’i himself.  By the order of Da’i, persons (aamil) from the ranks of Da’wat are fixed to lead the prayers, meet the people for their personal assistance, handle different committees and help in exercising the Isma’ili faith properly.
The Aamil or Saheb-e-Razaa, who is appointed by the Da’i-e-Mutlaq in a place where a sizable population of Bohras exist, is granted the permission to perform the religious ceremonies of the believers.  He also leads the local congregation in religious, social and community affairs and has the responsibility to impart religious knowledge and train the people as per community traditions. Mainly in the month of Moharram or Ramazaan or when the need arises, the authoritative person be it a Da’i, Ma’zoon, Mukaasir or Ra's ul-Hudood visit those places controlled by Aamil and administer the community affairs, settle the internal conflicts and give important guidelines for welfare and education.  Such towns normally have a mosque and an adjoining assembly hall (jamaa'at-khaana) where socio-religious functions are held. The local committees manage these properties and oversee the social and religious activities of the local Bohras which they directly report to the central administration of the Da'i through the local Aamil.
Unfortunately, Alavi Bohras are misquoted as Aliyya Bohras in historical and cultural accounts, especially by the people who were hostile and hateful to them to be called by the name derived from Ali. Hence it was their deliberate attempt to call the Alavi Bohras by misnaming or mispronouncing the name Alavi. But now through the website the World knows them by Alavi Bohras – as a distinct community centered in Vadodara. They have their unique religious, social, cultural, financial, educational setup and have well-knitted administration independent of any sectarian influence.

Missionaries (Du'aat)<br><br>
 	 
 	 

 	 
 	Hal Jazaa ul-Ihsaane illal Ihsaan? - Is the Recompensation of Goodness anything but Goodness?
 	 
 	Starting from the period of seclusion (daur us-satr) of the Faatemi Taiyebi Imaams starting from 21st Imaam Taiyeb (as) in 12th century AD till now, the chief missionary - Da’i-e-Mutlaq operates as the sole representative of the Imaam (as) in the seclusion. He has a great command and influence on the belief and practices of the Taiyebi Bohras. The first missionary (Da’i-e-Mutlaq) Saiyedna Zoeb, the son of Moosaa (d. 546 AH/1151 AD), carried on the mission from 532 AH/1138 AD in Yaman after the seclusion of the Imaam.  Total 24 missionaries (Du’aat-e-Mutlaqeen pl. of Da’i-e-Mutlaq) served the mission in Yaman till 974 AH/1567 AD.  Then the centre of the mission (markaz-e-Da’wat) got transferred to Ahmedabad (Gujarat). Bohras remained as a united single community till the 26th Da’i-e-Mutlaq Saiyedna Dawoodji Burhaanuddin, the son of Ajabshah (d. 999 AH/1591 AD) in Ahmedabad. A major split occurred after this which resulted in the formation of two groups – Dawoodis, who believed in the appointment of 27th Da’i-e-Mutlaq Saiyedna Dawoodji Burhaanuddin, the son of Qutubshah (d. 1021 AH/1612 AD) and Sulaymaanis.
After the death of 28th Dawoodi Da’i-e-Mutlaq Saiyedna Shaikh Aadam Safiyuddin (d. 1030 AH/1621 AD) in Ahmedabad, a major split occurred in mainstream Dawoodi Bohras and those who adhered to the rightful authority (da'iship) of the 29th Da’i-e-Mutlaq, the grandson of 28th Da'i, Saiyedna Ali Shamsuddin, the son of S. Ibraheem (d. 1046 AH/1637 AD), the Martyr (shaheed) came to be known as Alavi Bohras. This schism divided the mainstream Dawoodi Bohras into two different communities viz. Alavi Bohras and Dawoodi Bohras (who stuck to the mainstream name that was before the split).
The 32nd Da’i-e-Mutlaq Saiyedna Jivabhai Ziyauddin (d. 1130 AH/1718 AD) on the instructions of 31st Da’i-e-Mutlaq Saiyedna Hasan Badruddin (d. 1090 AH/1679 AD) shifted the seat of Da’wat from Ahmedabad to Vadodara (Badri Mohalla) in 1110 AH/ 1699 AD. Total 7 missionaries (Du’aat-e-Mutlaqeen pl. of Da’i-e-Mutlaq) served the mission in Ahmedabad from 974 AH/1567 AD till 1090 AH/1679 AD. Since then the community has its centre in Vadodara and it became the cradle of the mission. During the period of 35th Da’i-e-Mutlaq Saiyedna Noorbhai Nooruddin (d. 1178 AH/1764 AD), Surat city became the seat of Da’wat for a short span of 20 years. It is the endeavors and efforts in the various fields by their missionaries (du’aat) that has led to the present progress and prosperity of Alavi Bohras. It is the result of their unending efforts that the community is now in the lap of a modern age with the realization of the wholesome commitment of a true faithful Bohra towards personal-social relations and it has achieved excellence in the field of education and business.
The illustrious and learned 41st Da'i, Saiyedna Jivabhai Fakhruddin (1347 AH/1929 AD), was an accomplished scholar, a prolific writer and poet, a capable organizer and a man of vision. He made the handwritten copies of numerous old manuscripts to make is accessible to the pupils for higher studies. He composed different genre of poetry in Arabic, Urdu, Persian and Lisaan ud-Da'wat on varied topics such as merits of Ahl ul-Bayt (as) - the household of Mohammad ul-Mustafaa (saws), the pillars of Islaam and Imaan, morals, merits of Moharram ul-Haraam and Ramazaan ul-Mo'azzam, truly guided mission (da'wat ul-haqq), Imaam and Da'i, martyrs of Karbala and Imaam Husain (as), the city of Vadodara, merits of faithful believers and who serves the Da'wat selflessly, Qur'an-e-kareem etc. He named his composition as "Diwaan-e-Haseen". It is a practice to recite the selected compositions or verses (abyaat) in the assembly (majlis) of Da'wat. Some of his compositions have become so famous that have got memorized by the majority of the people. During the period of fifty years of his mission, he re-vitalized the community, fostered strong faith, organized the mission's objectives with broad-mindedness and far-sightedness, promoted welfare and education, guided the community to shun the irreligious customs, practices and social vices, and emancipated the community from the clutches of ignorance.
The 42nd Da'i, Saiyedna Fidaali Badruddin (1377 AH/1958 AD) was a strong man of principles and discipline. During his time a number of community buildings were constructed for the welfare of the people. He always took the path of truth and justice and stayed in Mumbai for 9 months in 1366 AH/1947 AD to safeguard the community from the evil eyes of the hypocrites. The 43rd Da'i, Saiyedna Yusuf Nooruddin (d. 1394 AH/1974 AD), has the distinction of constructing the most splendid and beautiful mosque "al-Masjid un-Nooraani ul-Alavi" at Vadodara in 1393 AH adorned by the delicate calligraphy and dressed in the white marble. The huge task of building this mosque continued for 6 yrs and it was the most sought after destination for sight-seers in Vadodara. All these missionaries (du'aat) led the Faatimid mission to the same cause and shaped the life of the believers and their deeds (a’amaal) in accordance with the teachings of Qur'an-e-Kareem and Isma'ili Jurisprudence (fiqh).

 	al-Hilmo Saiyed ul-Akhlaaq: The Wisdom is the Master of the Morals
 	 
 	The present 45th Da’i-e-Mutlaq or Da'i uz-Zamaan (the da'i of the present time) i.e. the representative (naa'ib) of Imaam uz-Zamaan (the imaam in the progeny of Imaam Taiyeb), Haatim ul-Khayraat, Rabi' ul-Barakaat Saiyedna Abu Sa'eed il-Khayr Haatim Zakiyuddin Saheb (tus) has continued his predecessor's endeavors with particular emphasis on strengthening the community's relationship with other community leadership and by following Islaamic practices by promoting and spreading awareness about the Faatimid identity and Isma'ili legacy. 
His birthplace is Badri Mohalla, Vadodara his birth date falls on 8th Rabi' ul-Awwal 1379 AH/10 September 1959 AD, Thursday.  Under the graceful hands of his grandfather, the 43rd Da'i ul Mutlaq Saiyedna Yusuf Nuruddin saheb (d. 1394 AH) and Mukaasir ud Da'wat Bhaisaheb Nazarali (d. 1397 AH), he completed his formal deeni education and then took khusoosi daras of 'Uloom e Da'wat. For graduation and post-graduation he stayed in Mumbai for 5 years (1979-1984 AD) studying Arabic Language and Literature with Islamic Studies in Mumbai University. During his stay in Mumbai, he did all things possible to enrich the library of Da'wah Shareefah by acquiring Isma'ili-Taiyebi MSS and rare Islamic books.
During the Da’iship of his beloved father, the 44th Da'i, Saiyedna Taiyeb Ziyauddin saheb, he being Ma’zoon (a spiritual status after da’i) from 1984 AD, he shouldered the responsibility of educating people for the betterment of the community.  Now that he is on a status of Da’i al-Mutlaq from 2015 AD, he sees to it that the 'Ilmi, Commerce and Social relations with other community members are maintained. He took very strong step and robust decision in 1423 AH/2011 AD by sending his eldest son Bhaisaheb Sa’eed ul-Khayr, who is now elevated to the status of Mazoon e Mutlaq, to Qumm, Iran for graduation in Arabic Language and Literature.  It is for the time that anyone from Qasr-e-‘Aali has travelled to the land of Iran for higher studies.  It is the holy land of Du'aat who migrated to Egypt in the service of Fatimid (Faatemi) Imaam during 4th and 5th century AH. Knowing the importance of Education and this being the foundation of Da’wat e Haqq (divine mission), Saiyedna saheb took personal interest in educating and specializing the Abnaa (children) of Da’wat in various fields.
At present Saiyedna saheb's eldest son Sa'eed ul Khayr Bhaisaheb 'Imaaduddin saheb DM is Mazoon al-Mutlaq as well as Mansoos who was elevated on 4th Rabi' ul Aakhar 1442 AH/19th Nov 2020 AD. Saiyedna saheb's younger brother, Mohammad Bhaisaheb Nuruddin saheb DM is on the status of Mukaasir al-Mutlaq since 7th Rajab 1430 AH/29th June 2009 AD after the demise of Mukaasir al-Mutlaq Dr. Husain Mo’eenuddin on 13th Shawwaal 1429 AH/12th October 2008 AD.  The status of Ra's ul-Hudood is headed by his youngest brother Dr. Zulqarnain Bhaisaheb Hakeemuddin who was assigned this responsibility along with Mukaasir al-Mutlaq. When Saiyedna saheb did Nass-e-jali and appointed-declared his eldest son as his successor 46th Da'i al-Mutlaq, Mukaasir al-Mutlaq was awarded a unique laqab as "Siqat ud-Da'wat il-Haadiyat il-'Alaviyah" (SDHA) and Ra's ul-Hudood was awarded a special laqab as "Naasir ud-Da'wat it-Taiyebiyah" (NDT).
He played a pivotal role in revamping the syllabus of Madrasah Taiyebiyah by making the learning of Lisaan ud-da’wat compulsory for all pupils. He is always there to guide and give special inserts in publishing a number of books highlighting Alavi faith and practices. The time when the website www.alavibohra.org was conceptualized in 1425 AH/2004 AD along with bi-monthly deeni newsletter "Mishkaat ul-Haadi", he took a forefront in vitalizing and providing subject matter as per the demand of time. Keeping pace with changing times and the World of Mobile Information, he envisioned the way to reach to the farest and smallest member of the community, by developing the Mobile App "Ahl uz Zikr". He eased the matrimonial related complications by making al-Vezaarat ul-'Alaviyah (the office of ad-Da’wat ul-Haadiyah) the centre of all these activities, promoted youth activities, women welfare, medical centers and camps, educational skills for teachers, higher education, literacy, trade and business etc.
He offered Hajj e Tamatto’-Pilgrimage to Makkah-Madinah along with his beloved father 44th Da’i in 1412 AH/1992 AD with the group of 82 mumineen.  It is after this Hajj, he compiled the book consisting of the Hajj arkaan and its manaasik.  He himself took special sessions and prepared mumineen for how to perform proper and perfect Hajj.  In 1420 AH/1999 AD, Saiyedna saheb with 44th Da’i, undertook long journey of 42 days for Ziyaaraat e Mubaarakah in Iraq, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, Syria and Yemen.  It is due to his efforts and encouragement,  many more people are opting to go for the Ziyaarat in Karbalaa and Najaf instead of wasting money at some other tourists destinations.  Extensive Sabaq with literature has been arranged for the people going for ‘Umrah Mufradah that has increased manifold by every passing year.
For every small or big spiritual or social occasion, printed literature is furnished by Saiyedna saheb’s office giving appropriate instructions to the applicants.  24 Hudood (person with specifically assigned task) are there to perform the religious ceremonies as per guidelines defined since centuries and on Taiyebi Tenets.  Be it at Devdi Mubaarak – Residence of Saiyedna saheb, masjid, community hall, private majlis, graveyard for the occasions pertaining to Inauguration, Sehra, Birthday, Marriage, Misaaq (divine oath), Roza-iftaari, Ziyaafat, Khatnah or Deceased person’s Sadaqallaah.  Saiyedna saheb and his close associates manages all these affairs.  This is the reason that Devdi Mubaarak is abuzz every time with the spiritual proceeding of believers.
He has retained the amount of mehr of Rs. 1000/- fixed by his father al-Maulaa al-Muqaddas, which was previously Rs. 200/- during the time of 41st Da'i, for the marriage proposal given to the bride and it is on a discretionary power of an individual to give or not to give anything apart from mehr.  There is no concept of dowry and one is free to arrange anything for the marriage of her daughter as per his financial condition, but under the pre-defined religious laws. His tenure as a Mazoon and now as a Da'i is marked by the constructions of new mosques, guest houses (musaafir-khaanas), mausoleums and community halls. His acumen in Fatimid architecture could be seen in the building constructed under his supervision.  This has earned him an able designer and future planner as far as the space utility is concerned.  Masjid-e-Faatemi, Masjid-e-Haatemi, Masjid-e-Shehaabi, Masjid-e-Bardi, Mazaar of Saiyedna Ameeruddin saheb (aq), Saiyedna Nuruddin saheb (aq), Saiyedna Badruddin saheb (aq) are the master-pieces of his expertise.
The concept of pre-wedding religious counselling and personal consultation was initiated some years back and now, one can find positive results out of it as the instances of marital discord and divorces has considerably decreased.  In the majlis known as Dhaaru-Fixing of the date of marriage and the day when wedding cards are distributed in the community, the to be-couple sits in front of Saiyedna saheb and he himself explains the realities of married life, its responsibilities and sacrifices.  Likewise by the Razaa-permission of Saiyedna saheb, the training sessions of the Baaligh children-the children who has attained the age of puberty and has to give to Saiyedna saheb the Oath of Loyalty (Misaaq) which is meant for the Imaam of the Time from the Progeny of Prophet Mohammad (saws) known as “Imaam uz Zamaan (as)”, is regularly conducted before the majlis of Misaaq.  The children are educated with the Pillars of Islam and Faith, their responsibilities of being an Alavi Bohra, their obligatory deeds as per the Cannonical Law of Islam from dawn to dusk, their relationship with their family members, relatives, neighbours, employees and community members.  One who gives misaaq enjoys all the spiritual attachments and absolute guidance from Saiyedna saheb.  This gives him the identity of being an Alavi.
Publications meant for religious knowledge and awareness (deeni ma’lumaat) is his prime objective. Knowing that the books are the mother of development and discipline, he always emphasized in reading good things for fruitful results.  Several books highlighting Isma’ili-Taiyebi faith and facts were published to make his followers make aware of their religious and social duties.  Books such as:
•	Ashaab ul-Yameen - History of 24 Yemeni Du'aat and their works in Lisaan ud Da'wat and English.
•	Kitaab ul Wasaaya - Precepts of Faatemi A'immat Taahereen AS compiled from the book Da'aaim ul Islaam.
•	Kitaab ul-Walaayah from Da'aaim ul-Islaam - how sincerity is incumbent on a follower for his Imaam.
•	Makhzan ul-Masaa’il - 363 Q&A relating to wide range of topics strengthening the knowledge of a beginner.
•	Lisaan ud-Da’wat – 3 books for learning the language of Da’wat in detail.

Pledge - An Oath of Loyalty<br><br>
 	 
 	 

 	 
 	Qul la As'alokum 'alayhe Ajran illal Mawaddata fil Qurbaa: Say (O Mohammad), I am not asking you any return by following the Shari'at, but only Love and Respect for my Ahl ul Bayt
 	 
 	These words of honour and the articles of oath are the excerpts from the numerous lectures of Saiyedna, delivered during the month of fasting-Ramazaan and the month of mourning-Moharram.  Apart from these two months there are several socio-religious occasions in which these articles of pledge is voiced among the believers and they are regularly guided to follows it.  The prime concern is the youth of the community who are educated, sensitized and encouraged about these minute things that will in turn leave great impact on the social harmony and mutual progress. 
Saiyedna saheb says that, “O my Spiritual Children! Every one of you should adhere to the oath given to his Lord.  I am here as a witness to it.  This pledge, I am repeating all the time so that it remains afresh in your minds.  As the head could not alone survive without the body, so I am your head and you all form the community as its body.  This pledge is the command and communication from the head to its body.  To remain alive and attached to its head, the body has to follow its commands.  What you are is based on the way you take the pledge.”
The Spiritual head (da'i) is esoterically considered as the right hand of Imam. The way kissing of Black Stone of Ka'bah is considered graceful, giving pledge to the da'i of Imam is similarly graceful. While kissing the Black Stone, a pilgrim prays "O God! I have duly returned to you the trust entrusted to me, and the covenant I has made to you has been fulfilled, so that this act of mine may bear testimony to its fulfillment." This is only after giving pledge to da'i.
1.	I will praise my Creator and Sustainer, Allaah, for all the hidden or evident bounties that He has bestowed upon me.
2.	I will remain obedient throughout my life to my spiritual master-da’i and act according to his teachings and orders.
3.	I will respect my traditional attire and will make it the part of my identity, whenever or wherever I might be.
4.	I will marry an honest and noble lady of my community to keep shamelessness away, will do jihaad to protect myself from devilish acts and will perform pilgrimage to keep poverty away.
5.	I will respect others, all of them, irrespective of their beliefs, creed or culture.  I will speak softly, truly and reverently and will never betray them.
6.	I will love my family, relatives, community and the nation.  Being from society I will serve my society.
7.	I will abide by the lessons of my elders and well-wishers as they are ones who point to my mistakes and try to make me a better individual.
8.	I will acquire knowledge till my last breath from the people of wisdom and will make my living meaningful and peaceful
9.	I will persistently make efforts to educate my children and look after my family.  I will fulfill their needs and help them cultivate good habits.
10.	I will earn money through lawful and just ways.  I will never break trust of my employer or my employees and will assist them in the best possible ways.
11.	I will engage myself more in the religious obligations as it encompasses the worldly affairs.  I will always try to make my permanent abode beautiful after my death.
12.	I will pray to keep pride away, will visit tombs of my spiritual masters to keep wickedness away and will fast to keep unwanted desires away.
13.	I will mourn on the martyrdom of Imaam Husain and remember the calamities inflicted on his household and will prepare myself that my shortcomings are nothing as compared to the sufferings to my Imam.
14.	I will clean my teeth and hands after every meal to keep illness away, will take bath regularly to keep forgetfulness away and will maintain good friendship to keep fear away.



 	Isma’ili-Taiyebi Faith
 	 
 	 

 	 
 	Wal 'Ilmo 'indallaahe: The Knowledge is only with Allaah
 	 
 	Alavis strongly believes in the Tawheed (Oneness) of Allaah which, according to them, is not only limited to Allaah but also applies to His representative as well i.e. A person of highest religious status (Saheb-e-Maqaam or Hujjat)who in the religious hierarchy is the topmost spiritual authority in his time, may be the Prophet or the spiritual master (imaam) of his progeny or his missionary (da’i) in their respective times.  They believe in the Tajreed of Allaah which implies that the Creator (Allaah, khaaliq) is entirely different from the Creation (makhlooq). Creator is always complete and His Creation is always incomplete. Religion of Allaah (shari’at) is a path that is taken by the Creation to transform itself from incompletion to the completion under the guidance of the Prophets of Allaah. Creation is totally dependent on its Creator. They believe in the Tanzeeh of Allaah which means that the Names of Allaah (al-Asmaa ul-Husnaa) does not at all apply to Allaah The Almighty but to His first creation ‘First Intellect’ (aql-e-awwal) who accepted the Call (da’wat) of Allaah on its own.
The core of the Isma’ili-Taiyebi faith is to believe in the unseen things (ghayb) and in the succession of those spiritual authorities who had remained guardian of the Mission of Allaah, right from the first Prophet Aadam till the present day.  The utterance of this faith is recited in each and every prayer.  This belief states that, Heaven (Jannat) is true, Hell (jahannum) is true, Resurrection (ba’ath) is true, Balance of deeds (mizaan) is true, Way for Salvation (siraat) is true, Accounts of actions in the Grave (hisaab) is true, Angels (malaa’ikah) are true,  Jinn are true, Reward for right-doers (thawaab) is true, Retribution for wrong-doers (‘azaab) is true, Day of Resurrection (qayaamat) is true, for Forgiveness of a believer the Intercession of his Imaam (shafaa’at) is true, this Material World (duniyaa) will get destroyed (faani) is true and the Hereafter (aakherat) will always remain (baaqi) is true.
Alavis believe in Prophet-hood of the divine Prophets and the divine books and messages revealed upon them i.e. nubuvat-risaalat of Ambiyaa-Mursaleen, Vicegerency of the People of Prophet (ahl ul-bayt) i.e. wasaayat of Awsiyaa, the institution of supreme spiritual and temporal leadership from the progeny of the Vicegerent of the Prophet i.e. the imaamat of A'immat (pl. of imaam) and the call or mission (da'wat) of the missionaries (du'aat) of the Imaam.  The Isma'ili faith, unlike mainstream Islaam, is based on the tradition of hierarchical appointment.  In the case of an Imaam, the predecessor Imaam appoints his successor only from his sons and this goes on from father to son in the progeny of Prophet Mohammad ul-Mustafaa (saws).  In the case of a Da’i, the predecessor Da’i can appoint his successor not only from his sons but also from the people of Da’wat ranks who deserves the post having the highest state of knowledge, wisdom and governance.  Each authority at the lower rank has to work with total devotion and submission to the one at the higher rank. There cannot be any compromise or self-captivation in it. The religious authorities who work with Ma’zoon and Mukaasir are known as Hudood in the Isma'ili terminology. The hadd (a person of a rank with special duty - pl. hudood) at the upper rank demands total obedience from the hadd at lower rank. Thus, the Isma'ili faith is a religion of subservience (tabaa’at) and obedience (itaa’at) to the Spiritual authorities (darajaat-e-ruhaaniyah).  No dissent in any form is ever permitted. 
A beginner or an outsider is not at all allowed to discuss about the religious intricacies unless he knows the basics of Isma’ili-Taiyebi faith.  If he has some query then he can ask and consult the religious authority, but only after the acquisition of a necessary primary knowledge of Islaamic faith (shari’at).  Reason behind this is because of the fact that it is not based on the sole literary meaning or grammatical interpretation or translation of the Qur’an with the disposition of the lawful deeds but its very essence is obtained only by knowing its hidden implications (baatin) and esoteric meaning (ta’weel). Isma’ilism in general and Taiyebism in particular, deals with the allegorical interpretation of the pillars of Islaam, a peculiar Isma'ili philosophy on unity (wahdaaniyat), creation (takhleeq), cosmology (aflaak), eschatology (mabda’-ma’aad), institution of Prophet-hood and Imaamat. Therefore, an Isma'ili-Taiyebi believer should submit himself to the authority of the Imaam or his deputy Da’i unquestionably on the powers and orders regarding religion, family and society with the strict observance of customary obedience to the higher rank of the religious hierarchy. Only those at the advance stage of learning could aspire to know the hidden meaning of Islaamic thoughts and tenets.  Due to this reason the Da'i take strict oath of allegiance (bay’at-mithaaq) from his follower in the name of the Imaam of present time (imaam uz-zamaan) so as to pledge his absolute loyalty to the Imaam or the Da'i and his sincerity to follow Isma’ili faith in each and every aspect of his life.
Thus, at the age of puberty every Bohra believer (mu’min) pronounces the traditional and compulsory oath of allegiance in front of his Da’i which requires the initiatee to adhere to the Islaamic law (shari'at) and accept the religious leadership of the Da’i of his time (da’i uz-zamaan).  This oath is renewed each year on 18th Zul Hijjah, the auspicious day when Prophet Mohammad ul-Mustafaa (saws) appointed his son-in-law and cousin Ali ul-Murtazaa, the son of Abu Taalib, as his vicegerent during the farewell pilgrimage (hijjat ul-wadaa’) at the place known as “Ghadeer-e-Khumm”, when the Prophet was returning from Makkah to Madinah in 10 AH/15th March 632 AD.  Apart from Eid ul-Fitr and Eid ul-Azhaa, Alavi Bohras consider this as a day of the completion of Islaam and celebrate it as Eid-e-Ghadeer-e-Khumm. The Alavi Bohras follow Faatimid School of thought and jurisprudence which recognizes seven pillars of Islaam.  Among all the pillars, devotion and submission (walaayat) to the religious authority (da’i) is the supreme and most important pillar without which all the remaining six pillars are meaningless.  Each pillar has seven obligations (faraa’iz pl. of farz) and twelve traditions (sunan pl. of sunnat).  These pillars are as follows:
•	Walaayat - Love and devotion for Allaah, His Prophets, Imaam and his representatives (du’aat pl. of da’i).<br><br>
•	Tahaarat - Ritual purity & cleanliness<br><br>
•	Salaat - Five daily prayers<br><br>
•	Zakaat - Purification through paying of religious dues to a Da'i in the month of Ramazaan<br><br>
•	Sawm - Fasting for 30 days of the month of Ramazaan<br><br>
•	Hajj - Pilgrimage to Makkah and Madinah in the last month of Zul Hijjah<br><br>
•	Jihaad - Holy war against the infidels (kaafireen) and hypocrites (munaafiqeen)<br><br>


The Unfortunate Event in the History of Alavi Bohras
The Demolition of the Holy Graves<br><br>
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
Innallaaha la Yohibbo man kaana Mukhtaalan Fakhoora: Indeed Allaah does not like any arrogant braggart (who talks immodestly or with excessive pride about himself)
 
<br><br>
 
Every history is marked with good and bad memories. One such pathetic and unfortunate event that occurred in the history of Alavi Bohras, which has left deep scars in the hearts of mumineen, was the one which took place on the ill-fated day 10-11-1416 AH/29-3-1996 AD in Saraspur Qabrastan, Ahmedabad. The cemetery manager ordered the demolition of the holy grave (qabr-e-mubaarak) of 30th Alavi Da’i Saiyedna Abd ut-Taiyeb Zakiyuddin (d. 1047 AH/1638 AD), the son of 28th Da’i-e-Mutlaq Saiyedna Shaikh Aadam Safiyuddin (aq) in the pretext of constructing the new mausoleum. Several rounds of talks with the cemetery authorities and their higher-ups resulted in giving guarantee of constructing the grave afresh on the same place.  These talks were full of deceit and shrewdness.  Once again on 7-4-1417 AH/21-8-1996 AD they exhibited their unending cruelty and hatred by demolishing the grave of 29th Alavi Da’i Saiyedna Ali Shamsuddin Shaheed (aq), the son of S. Ibraheem and the grandson of Saiyedna Shaikh Aadam Safiyuddin Saheb (aq) – the 28th Da’i-e-Mutlaq. Saiyedna Ali Shamsuddin Shaheed (aq) is the most eminent and distinguished Da’i (missionary) because Alavi Bohras derive their name from him.
The succession of Du’aat of Alavi Bohras is established on the truthfulness, loyalty and bravery of Saiyedna Ali Shamsuddin Shaheed (aq) who sacrificed his life in the way of Allaah. He guarded ad-Da’wat ul-Haadiyah (rightly guided mission) and showed the path of Paradise to the believers.  Atrociousness and inhumanity of the cemetery management did not stop at this event. To extinguish the fire of protest and dissent which rose after these cruel episodes, the higher authorities of Dawoodi community gave assurance to consider the matter and resolve it as soon as possible by reconstructing the graves of Alavi Da’is. But that was all patch-up work done by them and nothing concrete has been done until now.  Alavi authorities never lose an opportunity to remind their Dawoodi counterparts about this pending demand to restructure and restore the graves.  Rampant corruption and partiality has eclipsed the process of getting justice from the local reinforcement agencies and the court of law.
Prophet Mohammad Rasoolullaah (saws) has said that ‘Place between my grave and my pulpit is one of the gardens of Paradise (Jannat).’  The grave of Rasoolullaah (saws), here, means the time after his death and the pulpit means the time of the Day of Judgement (Qayaamat) when Imaam Qaa’im (as), the last imaam from the progeny of Rasoolullaah (saws) will reveal himself (do the Zuhoor). The place between the grave and the pulpit means the Prophet’s vicegerent (wasi), vicegerent’s progeny (imaam) and the progeny’s representative (da’i), who by the divine appointment (nass) guards and promulgates the Deen of Allaah in truthful and legible way. Hence the Da’i for the mumineen is the door to Paradise and the grave of the Da’i is the mortal remains where the believers come for spiritual shelter and salvation i.e. to take Barakaat of Ziyaarat.
One cannot imagine what fate Allaah Ta’aala will bring to the people who demolished the graves of Alavi Du’aat with whom thousands of faithful’s hearts and their sentiments are attached? Hence, Alavis feel that by demolishing the grave of their da’i, some mischievous elements have unsuccessfully targeted their very foundation.  Alavis still visit (do the ziyaarat) the same place in the mausoleum where the demolished graves of Da’is once stood.  If at all the culprits think that Alavis will forget graves of their Du’aat then it is a serious mistake on their part because removing the graves will not remove the remembrance and sacrifice of the People of Allaah (da’is) from the memory and hearts and this will remain perpetual as the reality has been noted down in the religious treatises (deeni Saheefah) that has been taught right from the beginning in religious school (deeni madrasah) to the children.
The main purpose of demolition of the graves was to remove the signs of spiritual attachment of Alavis from the Bohra cemetery. This mean task was carried out on the behest of some envious anti-Alavi elements in the Da’wat hierarchy of Dawoodis.  The fact behind the hatred and jealousy exhibited by Dawoodis is that both the Alavi da’is, 29th Da’i-e-Mutlaq Saiyedna Ali, the grandson of 28th Da’i-e-Mutlaq and 30th Da’i-e-Mutlaq Saiyedna Zakiyuddin saheb, the son of 28th Da’i-e-Mutlaq have been buried there since 4 centuries besides the grave of 28th Da’i-e-Mutlaq Saiyedna Shaikh Aadam Safiyuddin and all the graves of three Alavi Da’is are in a single mausoleum (mazaar).  This is the most concrete and existential proof and a factual account that favors the truthful appointment of Saiyedna Ali Shamsuddin Shaheed (aq) as the 29th Da’i-e-Mutlaq by his grandfather 28th Da’i-e-Mutlaq Saiyedna Shaikh Aadam Safiyuddin Saheb (aq) – who is a common Da’i of Alavi and Dawoodis.
Interestingly, before demolition, when any Dawoodi Bohra visitor used to come (do ziyaarat) to the mausoleum of Saiyedna Shaikh Aadam Safiyuddin Saheb (aq), unknowingly, they also did the ziyaarat of 29th and 30th Alavi Da’is. Hence it was very difficult for the Dawoodi authorities to explain their people the cause of the presence of graves of two Alavi Da’is besides the 28th Da’i in the same mausoleum, as they don’t believe in the succession of 29th and 30th Alavi da’is. Since the mausoleum of Saiyedna Shaikh Aadam Safiyuddin Saheb (as) is the place of visit of three Da’is (28th, 29th and 30th) of Alavis, they deserve the possession of the place more than anyone else.  To uproot the foundation of this confusion a well planned conspiracy was hatched to demolish the two graves of Alavi Da’is in the mausoleum.  Some years back, Sulaymaanis won the case of acquiring the land of the same graveyard where their Da’i is buried in a separate mausoleum. The Saraspur Qabrastan (graveyard) is the only place in India where all three Bohra communities (Alavi, Dawoodi and Sulaymaani) visit and pay respect to their respective da’is who were buried between the period of 975-1050 AH/1567-1640 AD.

 	Wa iny-yakaadul lazeena kafaroo la-yuzleqoonaka be-absaarehim lammaa same' uz-Zikraa wa yaquloona innahu la-majnoon. Wa maa huwa illaa zikrul lil 'aalameen: And those who disbelieve would almost stare at you with their evil eyes when they hear the warning, and they say: Most surely he is mad or possessed.  And it is naught but a reminder to the nations.
 	 
 	Allaah Ta’aala created humans as a final and complete being which is the sign of His Supreme Authority. The position of humans is above all His creations. Unlike others he needs society, education and work to survive. He, the Exalted made manifest from the hidden knowledge and the stored judgement in Aadam and Hawwaa (Eve), the two parents, a male and a female, as a cause for the creation of mankind and society to reveal His mighty power. He paired them and they procreated, and the children and the number increased. They were transferred through the chaste loins and pure approved wombs.  Alavi Society is based on 6 steps like everything which has 6 dimensions. These 6 steps is further rooted in 6 distinguished things created by Allaah Ta’aala for His divine mission-دعوۃ .
It is 1. Qur’an (القرآن ) – the divine book, 2. Nabi-نبي (warner) – prophet, 3. ‘Aalim-عالم (learned) – the vicegerent of the prophet, 4. Shaahid-شاهد (witness) – the imaam of the descendants of prophet, 5. ‘Aabid-عابد (pious man) – missionary in the place of imaam, and 6. Khalq-خلق (universe) – things into existence.
It is relayed by the eminent 15th century Sunni Egyptian author al-Maqrizi, Fatimid Caliph Imaam al-Mo'iz wished to impart the principles of compassionate society and governance to the leaders of the Kutama tribe and to deter them from an opulent lifestyle. He says, "I summoned you in my chamber so that you could see what I do when I am away from you and far from your eyes. My status exceeds yours only because I have responsibility over your affairs on earth and because Allaah Ta’aala has singled me out as your Imaam. I busy myself with letters that come to me from the east and west, to which I respond in my own hand."  This is how Imaam responded to each and every society members. The six dimensions or “M-م” of the Alavi Society in place of above mentioned things are:
1. Madrasah (مدرسۃ ) – religious seminary: It stands for the teaching of the holy Book where children learn the basics of their community. It is the beginning of their involvement in the social development and relations. The first heavenly order that the Prophet Mohammad received at Mount Noor under the Hira cave was “to read”. So it became necessary for every believer to acquire knowledge throughout his lifetime from the designated person and the representative of Prophet Mohammad from his progeny. So, Madrasah is not only meant for children but it is the learning hub for those who are keen in knowing the realities of creation. Prophetic traditions says, "Seditions appear and crush believers-your only salvation is your learning." Social health based on the overall knowledge is served by this “M” of Madrasah. The importance of reading which is the stepping stone of any learning institution could be well found in the foremost Qur’anic verses, “READ in the name of your Lord who created. Created man from an embryo. Read, for your Lord is most beneficent. Who taught by the pen. Taught man what he did not know.”   (al-Quran 96-1)
2. Misaaq (میثاق ) – covenant: After completing basic religious and social learning, a learner or an ordinary Alavi initiate steps into puberty and towards intellectual advancement. Now in order to become a member of a community and begin his spiritual journey with an Imaam, he has to give unconditional and lifetime oath of fealty or the promise for loyalty to the Imaam’s representative i.e. Da'i al-Mutlaq. This divine tradition and sublime submission was initiated from heavens and will be continued till the last day of this creation. The Prophets took this oath from their respective people of their time and they commanded their missionaries to do so in order to protect their faith. The initiate is also bound by this oath to keep secret the esoteric knowledge imparted to him by a hierarchy of teachers authirized by the Isma'ili Imaam. He has to renew this oath to Imaam every year on 18th Zul Hijjah known as Eid e Ghadeer e Khumm-عید غدیر خم .
Once the believer had solemnly bound himself through the oath, he could undergo a step-by-step introduction into 'wisdom'-not all at once, for that would exceed his mental capacity. 'You are being put to a test,' the Da'i would say to his disciples, 'For you are beginners, and a beginner is like an infant: you should start first with milk and only later nourish yourselves with food.'  This “M” of Misaaq induces religious responsibility into faithful’s life and it helps to bring maturity for social well-being. For this Qur’an says that, “When We made the covenant with the Prophets, and with you (O Mohammad), as with Noah and Abraham, Moses and Jesus son of Mary, a binding covenant, (It was) so that Allaah Ta’aala may ask the truthful of their sincerity. As for the infidels, He has prepared a painful punishment for them.” (al-Quran 33-7)
3. Masjid (مسجد ) – mosque: After offering covenant to Da’i, the head of the community, An Alavi tries his level best to fulfill all its obligations and this begins at the very doorstep of a mosque. The centrality of the mosque is inevitable for a believer. Each and every socio-religious activity revolves around it. Prophetic traditions says, "The mosque is where the pious live."  A believer goes three times daily to offer prayers. There he is educated and informed about different social programs and being a part of a community how he should serve his fellow members and actively participate in the social and welfare activities. This “M-م ” of Masjid-Mosque proves to be a perfect training centre for creating responsibility, positivity, respect and thoughtfulness among people. Being a learned and authoritative person, a Da'i in his capacity trains his followers in maintaining social etiquettes and ethos by imparting necessary knowledge in his sermons. Da'i is the soul of the mosque and with his prostration, people in the mosque prostrates in front of Allaah Ta’aala. The Qur’an says about a mosque which is the best place for worship, that “O sons of Adam, attire yourselves at every time of worship; eat and drink, but do not be wasteful, for Allaah Ta’aala does not like the prodigals.” (al-Quran 7-31)
4. Mazaar (مزار ) – mausoleum: It is an important place for a believer that is filled with spirituality and devotion. A holy person having special designation conferred by an Imaam in the spiritual hierarchy is buried here. After offering prayers in a mosque people come to pay respect to the mausoleum and take waseelah-intercession while doing supplication to fulfill their wishes in front of Allaah Ta’aala. Usually mausoleum or tomb of a Da'i or a religious authority is situated besides the mosque. It plays a key role in social bonding as each and every community member visit it daily or weekly or when he wishes. If anyone visits a Rawzah-mausoleum of a particular Da'i then it is said that, he took blessings of all those people who were in the covenant of that Da'i. Mazaar of a Da'i is also called “Rawzah” as it is like a paradise and one can feel its fervor and freshness by spiritually attaching himself to Da'i. Every believer is a martyr-Shahid and the mausoleum of a Da'i is the master of all martyrs who were from his believers. Visiting mausoleum is like going to the entrance and gate of paradise. If one has learned Qur’anic recitation in Madrasah, gave Misaaq to his Da'i and has an habit of coming to a mosque for prayers, then surely he will visit Mazaar.
In this account, Imaam Ja'far as-Saadiq addresses Kufan people and encourages them to visit the tomb of al-Husayn b. 'Ali: 'If one of you performs the hajj in the course of your lifetime and does not visit the grave of al-Husayn, then you have departed from one of the duties and rights of Allaah Ta’aala and His messenger. It is the duty ordained upon every believer.' Qur’an reiterates that same thing that, “The greediness of plenitude keeps you occupied, till you reach the grave. But you will come to know soon; indeed you will come to know soon.”  (al-Quran 102-1)
5. Majlis (مجلس ) – religious gathering: an assembly or a special private audience accompanied with prayer where a discourse of a Da'i is held is generally termed as majlis. It begins with the praise and elegy relating to the household of Prophet Mohammad or a religious dignitary associated with them. Prophetic traditions says, "The most commodious assembly is best."  The main majlis is held during the first 10 days of Moharram in the commemoration of the martyrdom of the grandson of Prophet Mohammad, Imaam Husain. Throughout the year different types of majlis are held during the inauguration of any place, oath of fealty, marriage, birthday, sehra, ziyaarat, weekly lectures, madrasah or mausoleum. As per the occasion and time, every member of the community more or less participates in these majlis. It accounts to be a crucial cord of social harmony and awakening as one who attends it comes to know his roots, history, tenets, good-evil aspects of life, relations with others and social customs.
Under the Fatimids, these type of private lectures or teaching sessions were organized for different categories of participants in Cairo, including the initiates, courtiers, high officials, women and royal women.  During the reign of Fatimid Caliph Imaam al-Mustansir Billah, his Da'i al-Mu'ayyad leaves nothing to be desired in the field of knowledge and rhetorical skill through conducting various majlis. He continued to be honoured as the connecting link and catalyst of an unbroken religious and social tradition extending from Fatimid Egypt to Tayyibi Yemen and India. Right up until today, after more than a thousand years of history, the entire Tayyibi community still regards him as their spiritual ancestor and social torch-bearer.  The holy book Qur’an says this point in a very beautiful way, “O you who believe, when you are told to make room in the assemblies, then make room; Allaah Ta’aala will give you more room to spread. When you are told to rise, then rise; Allaah Ta’aala will raise those of you who believe, and those who have knowledge, in position. Allaah Ta’aala is aware of what you do.”  (al-Quran 58-11)
6. Maa’edah (مائدۃ ) – meals taken together by family or community members in a single big plate: This big dinning plate is also called “thaal” in which special Bohra dishes is served collectively and all those sitting around it on the floor takes their meals together. Maa’edah is kept on a little elevated tool called “taraqqi”. There is a custom of arranging a big thaal decorated with all types of dishes on the first night of a new year in which the entire family sit and eat and pray for the prosperous year. There are strict rules governing the etiquettes of eating or sitting in a "thaal". 7 people used to sit in it and they all begin by taking a pinch of salt and reciting “bismillaah”. Washing hands before and after sitting on the thaal is compulsory. One should lick his fingers after finishing his meal and he should never leave a bit of food in the "thaal". People sit in Maa’edah in Jamaa’at-khaana and take lunch or dinner on various social or religious occasions.
Sociability increases among community members as they often sit together and discusses current affairs of their interest in a "thaal". Prophet Mohammad and his household taught the tradition of Maa’edah. It has become an inseparable part of Alavi Bohras’ social life. One can find this in this Qur’anic verse, said Jesus, son of Mary, "O Allaah Ta’aala, our Lord, send down a table well laid out with food from the skies so that this day may be a day of feast for the earlier among us and the later, and a divine sign from You. Give us our (daily) bread, for You are the best of all givers of food.”  (al-Quran 5-114)

 	Birth Registry of our Jamaa'at during the Da'wat of 41st Saiyedna Jivabhai Fakhruddin saheb AQ giving the glimpse of Names in the year 1307 AH
 	 
 	Our Jamaa'at Population - What was, What is and What should be? The Onus lies in our Hands
 	 
 	Past Era:
 	 
•	 	There was 27 staunch supporters (along with their families) with our 29th Da'i Saiyedna Ali Shamsuddin saheb AQ. The tenure of Muqaddas Maulaa’s Da’wat was 16 years – 1030 to 1046 AH.  Majority of these families had their relatives in Vadodara.
•	After the death of 31st Da'i Saiyedna Hasan Badruddin saheb AQ, in 1110 AH the 32nd Da'i Saiyedna Jivabhai Ziyauddin saheb AQ following Badruddin saheb’s AQ will and farmaan left Ahmedabad city and settled in Vadodara along with approximately 300 mumineen.  There were around 40 Alavi families residing in Vadodara before the Shahaadat of Saiyedna Ali saheb AQ in and around Fakhri Mohalla.
•	During the initial phase of the tenure of 41st Da'i Saiyedna Jivabhai Fakhruddin saheb AQ (1296-1347 AH), the total population of our mumineen was between 1250-1350 people. During this period a lot of families came from Surat and settled in Vadodara. This increased our population dramatically. Also many families of Nagoshiya joined our community and took Bay'at due to the hard efforts and graceful treatment of Muqaddas Maulaa.  This historic incident of total Nagoshiya faction coming into our community's fold marked sharp increase in our family count.
•	During the time of 42nd Da’i Saiyedna FidaaAli Badruddin saheb and 43rd Da’i Saiyedna Yusuf Nuruddin saheb (1347-1394 AH), a beautiful and Bohra trend of joint families was going on among every section of Alavi society. Having 7-10 children in one family was very much common and a matter of pride too. So during these 50 years i.e. 2 generations passed, there was a tremendous increase in our population. The total population of our mumineen residing in Vadodara, Nadiad, Mumbai and other small towns-villages was approximately 4000.
•	From the tenure of the Da'wat of Muqaddas Maulaa 44th Da’i Saiyedna Taiyab Ziyauddin saheb (1394-1436 AH) the count of the number of children kept on decreasing drastically. From 7-10, it reduced to 3 or 4. We faithfully recollect our Muqaddas Maulaa’s wise words pertaining to this worrying trend, “Previously houses were smaller in size but members were large in number,  still there was support, love and Barakat in the house. But in the present situation, houses are large in size with too many rooms but members are few to occupy it. Too many walls in the house acts like barriers in the hearts of the family members. Only namesake love prevails and there is no trace of Mahabbat-o-Barakat in the house. This is a reality of revolution with decaying family values.”
 	 
 	Present Era:
 	 
•	 	Presently our Jamaa'at population is around 8000. Every year around 45 infants are  born and approximately 60 deaths occur. It means that there is a deficit of 15. The rate of child birth has decreased as compared to the rate of marriages per year.
•	During this pandemic of Covid-19, this year more than 80 deaths have occurred. The birth rate has been continuously decreasing. So we could see the gap between death rate and birth rate is gradually widening.
•	Aqaa Maulaa Saiyedna saheb TUS wisely stated many times during these years after his ascension on the throne of Da'wat that, “O Parents! You should fix the marriages of your daughters early. Don’t delay their marriages by giving the excuse of higher education. Allow your daughters to work only if utmost necessary. It is not a rule that daughter should do service as per their educational qualification. Daughters should come at home before Maghrib. To get married to a righteous man and start a family in presence of their parents holds good for all daughters. A lot of problems arise if marriages are delayed.”
•	It is a serious matter that the graph of our Jamaa'at’s population is constantly decreasing since past 20 years. In these 20 years more than 120 girls of other communities have been married in our community. From among them there are a few who have still not accepted our basic Alavi traditions and practices. So it is doubtful that their offsprings will be a part of our society . In this way that particular family will distant itself from our community.
•	In recent past, about 10 families have left our community by abandoning our tenets, customs and traditions due to ignorance and misinformation.  Aqaa Maulaa Saiyedna saheb TUS openly invited them and even now the doors of Da'wah Shareefah is open, but what is required for a true Mu'min is a purity of heart.
•	In recent years many Alavi families or youth have settled abroad either in search of better job or education.  As they remain away from our society for years together and gets absorbed in non- Alavi culture, there remains always a danger of other worldly benefits and monetary aspects ruling the fragile intellect of our youth.  Not knowing our tenets and foundation youth gets easily trapped and becomes a cheap prey on the hands of other communities.  Parents find themselves helpless as they believe they have lost the battle.  Better earning and living abroad is not the only gain but better life for children as per Alavi atmosphere is the real gain of life.  The people of house is the only people during despair, sorrow and sickness.
 	 
 	What to do?
 	 
•	 	This is a burning problem in almost all the communities around the globe who want to safeguard their identity. The society has created this problem and so it is solely responsible to bring it’s solution.
•	The elders of the family play a key role in this. Their help and support is needed. They should nurture their children such that they become aware of the present scenario and also advise them to have children.
•	Today’s youth worries about the responsibilities of child's education and other expenses. Allaah Ta'aala says that, “A child is a blessing for the family. So do not fear about its sustenance. A child will be a source of increase in your wealth. Also he/she will become an apple of your eye.”  The youth should ponder over the fact that how our elders have lived in a small house. Our present condition is much better than theirs. So what is it that is stopping us from having children?
•	Not only education but social and cultural awareness is also necessary. Job, career or service is preferred over having children and starting a family. During the era of Muqaddas Maulaa, the average birth rate per an Alavi couple was 3-4 which has now reduced to 1-2. The couples fear the responsibilities and give up.
•	The families who are well to do, financially stable should plan out their families wisely and widely. Having more children will not affect them in any way.
•	One should think a thousand times before getting separated from a joint family. There is a lot of difference in the upbringing of children in joint family versus nuclear family. There is etiquettes, cultural values, shamefulness and respect in families where elders live. Also the elders can take care of their grandchildren if both the parents are working.
•	Women continue their career even after their marriage. So sometimes it happens that they become spendthrift. Unnecessary expenses are carried out which further becomes their needs. Due to such needs they continue their jobs which results in delay of bearing a child.  This untimely delay amounts to the condition where due to the age and illness, there is no space left for a career-oriented couple but to be happy with a single child.
•	 If you are working to cover the expenses of the house and if you feel that having a child will become an interference then such thinking is nothing but foolishness. Reducing the unwanted desires and temptations will in turn reduce the expenses.  Secondly, there are also many who want freedom after having a single offspring. The responsibility of one kid is enough for them. They don’t like being tied up at home. They assume that the responsibility of raising a child will end life . Perhaps their world will end. But truely speaking they are not aware about the reality and ethos of Shari'ah which states that, “The wish of a husband to have an offspring is superior to all other things. So the lady who loves her man, treats him with dignity and is a  child- bearer, is an excellent wife."
•	 This problem has come from a non-Islamic society - Western culture.  The media on every possible mode is spreading propaganda of having  two offspring with a couple. If a couple has one daughter and one son then it is considered as an ideal or complete family. Such type of thinking is senseless.   If there are only two children, the parents will pamper them a lot . They fulfil every small and big demand of their children. They spend a lot in giving their child best education and help them in getting best jobs. Then comes the time when parents reach their old age and are in need of their children. But at that time the son is usually abroad for establishing his career and maybe the daughter is married with non-Alavi boy and this act will automatically cancel her membership of our community. This implies that the efforts of the parents in upbringing their children have gone futile.
•	It is a matter of worry that in future we may face the problem of lack of relatives in any Khushi-Ghami (happy-sad) occasions. Due to this undesirable social trend of having just one daughter or one son from where will they get the relatives Maasi, Kaaka, Foi, Maama etc.? If there are more children and if they stay in a joint family then all the relations are well–maintained and that brings glory in all family occasions due to the mutual support and understanding.
•	Those having children and living in a joint family will have love in their heart for one another and generosity in their dealing with the relatives. Blood relation is on the top of all other virtual friendship and worldly companionship. They believe in togetherness and family values.
•	O Readers! Our aim is to make you aware of the current scenario of our closely-knit society. We have to join hands and together work for increasing our community's population. If we are not mindful of this problem of our community's population then maybe in the coming 50 years the situation might worsen and the things might slip out from our hands.
•	Our aim is not to hurt anyone's sentiments but to make the youth aware of the present truth. This should be a lesson for everyone so that they understand their responsibility towards the society. Our community is our main identity.
•	Those couples who have been married since 10 years should have concern about this matter. Their elders should counsel them and prepare mentally for having more children. This is not just about one or two families but it has to be a joint effort of everyone. If this advice is followed then insha-allaah in the next 50 years we will reap best results for our community.
•	Those mumineen who have been abroad since long time and their children have completed studies and are doing job, should marry them with an Alavi boy/girl to protect the integrity and identity of their family.  Parents in abroad should impart right knowledge, positive approach and communication with Vadodara mumineen. 
•	Those bachelors/singles who as a students staying abroad should think seriously about marriage as early as possible.  Living alone with family or parents is not good for a youth in long run.  Their parents in India should search for them a right partner whenever their children happen to be here in India.
•	Allaah Ta'aala loves those people among whom there is an increase in the number of the followers of Ahl ul Bayt AS. A believer’s child is a source of sustenance for all worldly beings. He is the light of truth and wisdom. The entire community prospers due to such mumineen.  By the intercession and Du'aa of Aqaa Maulaa Saiyedna saheb TUS, may Allaah Ta'aala bring prosperity and glory in our Alavi Jamaa’at.

Names and Naming: Now and Then

 	Da'wat e Shareefah Registry showing the names of mumineen‐muminaat during the time of 41st Da'i e Mutlaq Saiyedna Jivabhai Fakhruddin saheb AQ
 	 
 	Humans deviced names to identify different things. This gave birth to different languages, thoughts, customs and civilizations. Right from starting the Muslim society revolves around the beliefs defined by the divine books and scriptures. These again are strengthened and promulgated among the believers by the Ahl ul-Bayt of the Prophet of that time. Since long long time the naming of a child as per the Shari'at became an important aspect of a Mu'min's life. This is the reason when a child is born in our Jamaa'at, parents approach Saheb-e-Da'wat for a Mubaarak Naam and White Malmal Jhabhlu. On this white Jhabhla Saheb-e-Da'wat writes name with saffron.
99 beautiful names ‐ al-Asmaa ul-Husnaa which has been described in the holy Qur'an and assigned to Allaah Ta'aala is in fact the qualities of His representative‐Prophet who will spiritually elevate a believer in the eyes of Allaah Ta'aala for his eternal journey. These Prophets from M. Aadam Safiyullaah (as) till Mohammad ul Mustafaa (saws), has names either in Hebrew or in Arabic. In the beginning of Islaam, among Arabs and non‐Arabs in and around Arabian peninsula, Muslims followed the tradition of naming their children after the names of Prophets, their companions, historic events and places, honorific titles of learned men, Qur'anic words etc. This tradition continued in almost all sects of Islaam.
After the seclusion of our 21st Fatimid Musta'alavi Imaam Abul Qaasim at-Taiyeb (as) from Cairo in 528 AH, his missionaries-Du'aat in Yemen carried forward this tradition with the addition of naming the children after the Fatimid Imaams, their titles and companions. The representatives-Wulaat of Yemeni missionaries in India named their children after their masters-du’aat. One exclusive characteristics while selecting a name is prefixing a noun with "Deen". We can define this tradition of our Da'wat from the time of 3rd Da'i e Mutlaq Saiyedna Haatim AQ, whose laqab was "Mohiyuddin", means one who makes religion-Deen alive. After that we can find such laqab in every missionaries-Du'aat. Such prefixing with the word "Deen" became a tradition and now we can find such names in almost every household. For eg.
 	 
 	Names ending with Deen	LDA	 	Gujarati	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 
Najmuddin	نجم الدین	 	નજમુદ્દીન	The Star of the religion
Fakhruddin	فخر الدين	 	ફખરૂદ્દીન	The Pride of religion

Ziyauddin	ضياء الدين	 	ઝિયાઉદ્દીન	The Light of the religion
Nuruddin	نور الدين	 	નુરુદ્દીન	The Radiance of the religion

 	 
 	But around the tenure of 19th Da'i al Mutlaq Idrees Imaaduddin, apart from traditional names, in India local names of Gujarati communities got introduced and included in Bohra society. From then onwards, these names without having any religious, political or cultural identity became an integral part of Lisaan ud Da'wat. These names have travelled down to many generations and till now we name our children keeping alive our ancestral legacy.
To cite an example, we will first examine the non‐Islamic names of the authorities in different religious hierarchies attached directly with the affairs and service of the Rightly Guided Mission-ad-Da'wat ul-Haadiyah.

 	Apart from the dignitaries whose names find mention in the our Alavi historical accounts, there are many such names found till date among our common families who name their children as per the names of their ancestors to keep their memories alive. Before the migration to Vadodara, we had names suffixed with either "Khaan" or "Ji" or "Shaah", but after migration in 1110AH/1698 AD this trend gradually got transformed into "Ali", "Husain" or "Bhai" for male and "Bu" for female.

 	Now the disturbing trend is that with the onslaught and penetration of the social media in our everyday life, parents unknowingly opt for searching names for their newborn online on different Islamic portals. Having very little knowledge, they zero-in on the name that is too short, unislamic or irrelevant not related to our Mazhab of Ahl ul Bayt AS. It absolutely doesn't adorn to our Taiyebi traditions. Our A'immat and Du'aat has never approved such things as we are fully aware that we would be summoned by our names on Yaum‐e‐Mehshar. Names should have Barakaat of our Spiritual sahebs. A child will be known by the name his/her parents keep throughout his life.
In our house there is a big home parliament in choosing a name for our newborn where an array of members are involved. There is always a silver lining near dark gloomy clouds. Some parents choose from the names of their ancestors and name their child with a brilliant thought of keeping the memories of that person alive in their house whenever they call their child. This admirable tradition is still throbbing in the hearts of selected families. We all should pure-heartedly follow this graceful steps of our fore‐fathers.

 	Every New Year, the first ten days (asharah mubaarakah) of Muharram is marked by the historic event of the martyrdom of Imaam Husain (as), the son of Ali ul-Murtazaa (as) and the grandson of Prophet Mohammad ul-Mustafaa (saws), which is commemorated by setting up water stalls (sabeel)and doing mourning assemblies (majaalis-e-'azadari). In these ten days special morning discourses are held in the Main Mosque in the presence of Da’i-e-Mutlaq where Isma’ili-Taiyebi ideology and ethos is taught and a message of sacrifice and safeguarding ones belief is given taking into account the martyrdom of the people of Karbalaa.  In honour of the truth on which the whole event of Karbalaa stood and remembering the hardships, thirst and hunger of the martyrs of Karbalaa, the tradition of setting up of the water outlet (sabeel) made of pure Silver is still alive in the community.  The huge silver sabeel is built every year in Badri Mohalla, Vadodara, in a space between the Main Mosque and the residence of the Da’i.  It was first built in Mumbai on Mohammadali Road sixty years ago, during the time of 42nd Da'i, Saiyedna Fidaali Badruddin (d. 1377 AH/1958 AD. Every year, while going into the mosque, Da’i sits near this sabeel and drinks a sip of water offered by the care-taker and then proceeds for the discourse.
Congregational prayers and assemblies are held chiefly on every Friday, first night of every Hijri month, first ten days of Moharram – commemoration of the martyrdom of Imaam Husain in Karbalaa, 20th Safar – Chehlum (40th day after the martyrdom of Imaam Husain), 2nd Rabi’ ul-Awwal – Birthday and demise of the Prophet Mohammad ul-Mustafaa (saws), 4th Rabi’ ul-Aakhar – Birthday of Imaam uz-Zamaan and Da’i uz-Zamaan, 15th Rajab – Birth of Ali ul-Murtazaa (as) in Ka’bah, night of 27th Rajab – Ascension to Heavens of theProphet Mohammad ul-Mustafaa (saws) i.e. Me’raaj, night of 15th Sha’baan – Change of Qiblah and the night of forgiveness, 30 nights of Ramazaan – Midnight (nisf ul-layl) prayer recited with rhythmic verses (munaajaat), night of 17th Ramazaan – Remembrance of the Merits of Ali ul-Murtazaa (as), night of 19th Ramazaan – night of affliction (zarbat) on Ali ul-Murtazaa (as),night of 21st Ramazaan -  Martyrdom of Ali ul-Murtazaa (as), night of 23rd Ramazaan – the celebrated night of salvation, night of 30th Ramazaan – night of Eid ul-Fitr, 9th Zul Hijjah – day of Hajj Pilgrimage i.e. arafah, night of 10th Zulhijjah – night of Eid ul-Azhaa (ritual sacrifice – zabeehat), 18th Zul Hijjah – day of ascension of Ali ul-Murtazaa (as) at the status of wasi i.e. became vicegerent of Mohammad ul-Mustafaa (saws) at Ghadeer-e-khumm.
Social gatherings take place mainly on the occasions of naming of the new born child and circumcision (aqeeqah and khatnah), birthdays (milaad), religious oath (mithaaq), marriage (waleemah), inauguration or opening ceremony of a new house or business (iftitaah), commemoration of the late Da'i (urs), ritual food for a deceased person after 3 days, 40 days, 4 month 10 days and after a year (ziyaarat, chaalismu, cha-maasi, warsi), ritual food after the pilgrimage (wakeerah), engagement ceremony, joint ritual food in the month of Moharram and Ramazaan (niyaaz and iftaari).  A ceremony of fixing the date for marriage is a special occasion for both the bride and bridegroom.  Saiyedna call them along with their respective parents to perform this ceremony in which guidance is given to them to respect the needs of each other and share the responsibilities to form a peaceful home by acting as a sincere and loyal Alavi Bohra.  A wedding card is first offered to Saiyedna and then only it is distributed among relatives and friends.
There are 12 most prime Prophetic Traditions (sunnat) which every Alavi Bohra has to follow and conform to them in his life.  In it there are 6 types of relations with whom he has to build close, warm and amiable relationship.  They are 1) Parents, 2) Wife and Children, 3) Neighbor, 4) Close relatives, 5) Servants and 6) Community members.  Other 6 are based on social harmony and good character, they are 1)Always do good deeds, 2) Shun bad things, 3) Salute (say salaam)and be friendly  to others, 4) Invite people and prepare food for them, 5) Visit a sick person and 6) Always speak truth and be honest.
Discipline is supreme in every walk of a believer’s life.  Etiquettes and well-defined rules (aadaab) govern in meeting Saiyedna, visiting graves, taking meals, sitting in an assembly (majlis), sleeping, travelling, maintaining sexual relationship, acquiring lawful knowledge, answering nature’s call (bayt ul-khalaa, toilet), mosque, walking with parents, visiting a sick person, preparation of Friday prayers, observing fast, reciting Qur’an, talking with elders, constructing a house, behaving with a guest etc.
Offering pilgrimages to the holy shrines of the Prophets, Faatemi Imaam (A’immat-e-Faatimiyeen),celebrated missionaries (du’aat-e-amjadeen) and devout saints (Mawaali-e-Tahereen) who acted and proved to be a role model by sacrificing their life and wealth in guarding the Da’wat and Isma’ili Taiyebi faith, plays an important role in the devotional life of Alavi Bohras.   The places of pilgrimage abroad include Syria, Jordan, Karbalaa, Najaf, Bayt ul-Muqaddas, Misr and Yaman; while in India it includes Ahmedabad, Khambhat, Patan, Denmaal, Dongaam, Galiyakot, Kapadwanj, Umreth, Mai saheb etc.  There are rest houses or sanatoria (musaafir-khaanas) for the Zaa’ereen (visitors who come to the holy tomb for blessings-barakaat and supplications-du’a) providing them with lodging and boarding facilities in several cities run by charitable organizations.

 	Since the time when Da'wat was in Ahmedabad 975 AH/1568 AD, Alavi Bohras read, write and speak an Arabicized form (blended with Arabic vocabulary) of Gujarati language, called Lisaan ud-Da'wat il-'Alaviyah (LDA) i.e. the language of the mission of 29th Da'i Saiyedna Ali (aq), which is an amalgamation of Arabic, Urdu and Persian words and written in Arabic script. All the Da'wat correspondence, orders and documentary affairs are exclusively carried out in Lisaan ud-Da'wat il-'Alaviyah and the sectarian learning and education system is completely based on it.  Religious discourses and congregational lectures during the prayers are held in it.  The language of Allaah, His angels, His Prophets and His book is Arabic, so is the language of His Da’wat (divinely governed mission).  The missionaries or propagandists of this mission who came to India (Gujarat) from Egypt and Yemen to promulgate and preach Isma’ili faith, mainly during the reign of the 18th Faatemi Imaam, Maulaana Ma'ad al-Mustansir billah (as) (427-487 AH/1036-1094 AD), spoke Arabic language as it was their mother tongue.
The first rank of preachers (wulaat) in India were M. Ahmad, M. Abdullaah and M. Nooruddin who learnt local language (Sanskrit) and to make it more acceptable to a common man they skillfully blended it with Arabic. And this effort took quite long time to prepare people understand their message and mission. Hence Sanskrit or the then local dialects of Western India were blended with Arabic. This language then remained in vogue and developed as per the cultural, social and commercial exchange with various communities until the beginning of Muslim rule in Western India (697 AH-1090 AH/1298-1680 AD), when it got influenced with Persian and Urdu. Gradually the Arabic-Sanskrit language underwent drastic transformation due to the minimal use of Sanskrit words in day to day dealings and simultaneously with the addition of Persian and Urdu terms.
Old Gujarati now remained only for the support of sentence formation and the fact that due to the heavy dependence of Persian-Urdu idioms and phrases on Arabic root words, the Persian-Urdu expressions got readily and easily absorbed in the Arabic and Gujarati language frame-work.  This eventually gave birth to a great dynamic language during the rule of Mughals in Gujarat.  Arabic, Farsi (Persian) and Urdu all three of them were the official language of Mughal Sultanate.  This again gave a new dimension and strength to an already rich language.  In the beginning of the 11th century AH/17th century AD  this language was documented and was exclusively spoken by the Alavi Bohras named as Lisaan ud-Da'wat il-'Alaviyah.
This language has inherited its Gujarati syntax right from its inception, but retained majority of Arabic terminology along with the writing pattern of Naskh. Thus like Arabic, LDA- Lisaan ud-Da'wat is written from right to left and being nurtured and peppered by the richest of the world languages, it is the sum-up of variety of idioms-phrases and multiple dialects which makes it distinctive and comprehensive. Alavi Bohras residing globally speak this only language and its place of progress which is the centre of Da’wat since 3 centuries i.e. Vadodara plays a pivotal role to make everyone adhere to their roots i.e. their mother tongue. Every Alavi has to come to Vadodara to fulfill his religious as well as social obligations by keeping Lisaan ud-Da'wat il-'Alaviyah alive in his heart and tongue.
 	 
 	The Origin and Development of LDA:
 	 
 	Example 1: 1054 AH/1645 AD
 	 
 	Some of the oldest documents that Alavi Library has containing fragments of Lisaan ud Da’wat in form of instructions in Saheefat us Salaat written during the time of 28th Da'i ul Mutlaq.  Thereafter the period of 31st Da'i ul Mutlaq Saiyedna Hasan Badruddin bin Wali saheb AQ (1047-1090 AH/1638-1679 AD) was marked with persecution and oppression of Alavi Bohras in Ahmedabad by rival communities.  He was a prolific writer and an outstanding poet.  Being a Da'i and the head of the community he took full responsibility and authority to protect the rights and lives of his followers.  Through the power of his pen he appraised the local authorities of Ahmedabad about the injustice and harassment of his community.  By his wise words he raised his voice and addressed Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb (reigned 1067-1118 AH/1658-1707 AD) for help and justice.  Arabic and Persian was in his blood and by referring his anthology "Diwaan e Hasan", one could definitely judge his depth in both these languages.
When Saiyedna saheb AQ ascended on the throne of Da'wat e Shareefah in 1047 AH/1638 AD, the initial 7 years were tense and turbulent.  He was forced to stay in underground chamber for years together from where he corresponded with Sultanate authorities in Persian and Arabic language to take revenge of the martyrdom of Saiyedna Ali saheb AQ.  When the enemies were punished for their wrong-doings and the condition improved he revealed himself and started preparing mumineen to get settled in Vadodara.   Saiyedna saheb AQ and his associates elegantly started using local Gujarati language though in the form of scattered segments, to communicate with Alavi Bohras settled in different towns of Gujarat.
To prove this important claim, Saiyedna saheb AQ wrote Fa'al-Naama of Imaam Ja'far us-Saadiq AS in 1054 AH/1645 AD in a single book in Arabic, Persian and Lisaan ud Da'wat.  This unparallel book present in Alavi Da'wat library is a live testimony that it is from this period that mumineen widely used and understood Lisaan ud Da'wat.  Though in a very primitive form but it started gathering momentum and acceptance among mumineen.  But one thing should be kept in mind that amongst the Razaa-kaar of Da'wat e Shareefah, Arabic remained the prime and preferred language of Da'wat e Shareefah, Arabic and Persian remained the prime and preferred language of Da'wat's internal communications.  During this period there are many elegies and eulogies - maraasi & qasaa'id that are composed either in Arabic or in Persian.  But there is one unparallel and distinguished Qaseedah Alaviyah that Saiyedna saheb AQ composed in praise of 29th Da'i e Mutlaq Saiyedna Ali saheb AQ starts and ends in Persian but the couplets in between are in Arabic.

Aye Saa’il, nir Tu kar Tu ye amar thaki te thi je te Niyato kidhu che, te kaam upar pachi yaari maang Tu Allaah kare. Pachhi Tahqeeq Allaah chauroshe Tuh ne te Qaum ni Fitnat thaki.

Translation: O Questioner, be Alert! What has Allaah Ta’aala ordained upon you from His grace, some people with some means are doing dirty tricks and trials against you so that you disown the grace.  O Questioner! You surely wish to do what you want with good intention and then seek Allaah’s help.  Then, Allaah surely will free you from the people of dissension.  This is the reason that those people never leave a chance to create a discord for you.

 	Wa laa tazero Waazeratun Wizra Ukhraa: And no Bearer shall bear another’s Burden
 	 
 	Being Faatemi, Alavi Bohras use Hijri Lunar calendar which was established and published during the Fatimid rule in Egypt in the second half of 4th century AH/10th century AD. Before that the Imaam used to announce months and festivals verbally among his followers. The system of calculating months and days began right from the first prophet of Islaam, Aadam (as) and that knowledge continued from one prophet to another till the last prophet of Islaam, Mohammad ul-Mustafaa (saws) who came with the final message which also included how to calculate months and days.
This thing got transferred from tongue to chest into the holy Faatemi Imaams. Imaam is like a moon, so seeing the glowing (nooraani) face of Imaam and obeying his order for the commencement of a new month is like moon-sighting. The Misri-Alavi calendar has fixed number of days of each month based on the Lunar leap year (kabeesah) formula. An Alavi year has 355 days and in every 30 years 11 extra days are added i.e. in the span of 30 years; an extra day is added 11 times in different years in the last hijri month of Zul Hijjah making it 30 days, which has usually 29 days. All odd months have 30 days and all even months have 29 days. Therefore accordingly, the month of Ramazaan being an odd month always consists of 30 days. Da'iyullaah has strict control on printing of this calendar as the details of all important dates are noted in it with the timings of daily prayers. A single type of calendar is printed and is distributed in the whole community.

Alavi Bohra Women - Towards Liberty and Progress

 	Indeed Pious people are in the blissful places of flowing streams. With Peace and Security they will get entry into it. "Salaam" is the recognition of Nubuwat and "Amn" is of Wasaayat.
 	 
 	A woman is one of the most precious creations of Allaah Ta'aala. Qur’an e Kareem stresses on the fact that, Woman is an integral part of Mankind and could not be rendered helpless and subjected to humiliation in any form. Maulaatona Hawwaa AS was created from the upper ribs of her Master Maulaana Aadam Safiyullaah AS.  Ribs hold the heart and protect it.  So man should deal respectfully, gently and protectively with his woman. There is an entire Qur’anic chapter, Surat un Nisaa dedicated to women. Apart from this many chapters touches the most sensitive issues involving women thereby giving them justice and audience.  Issues relating to spiritual ascension, business, inheritance, marriage, divorce, personal hygiene, relationships, ethics etc.
Our Taiyebi Faith recognises the purity and chastity of woman at its highest level as far as her loyalty and devotion to her Faith and Family is concerned.  This is the reason we pay high reverence to Maulaatona Haajerah, Maulaatona Mariyam AS, Maulaatona Khadijah AS, Maulaatona Faatemah AS, Maulaatona Zainab etc.  Their sacrifice and pure-heartedness has become eternally a role model for the entire women world.  The perception and practices centred to muminaat-ladies which we follow today is a clear outcome of the traditions propounded by Ahl ul Bayt AS in Madinah and then by A'immat e Faatemiyeen AS (325-425 AH/937-1034 AD) in Cairo.  How can we forget the pivotal role of Maulaatona Hurrah al-Malekah RA, the representative of the 20th Imaam e Faatemi Maulaana al-Aamir AS (d. 426 AH/1035 AD), in fortifying and establishing the centre of Da'wat e Faatemiyah in Yemen.  Rasoolullaah SAWS said, “Your women are like gems.  Keep them guarded from the evil eyes of others.  No one of them should leave your house without your permission.”
Here it is important to note that, During the period of 40th Da'i e Mutlaq Saiyedna Amiruddin saheb AQ (d. 1296 AH/1879 AD), his zawjah taaherah-wife Umm ul Mumineen Maa Saahebah Qibu binte Shamsuddin RA (d. 1336 AH/1918 AD) and her daughter Faiji Saahebah Qaiyembu RA (d. 1344 AH/1925 AD) made crucial efforts in educating muminaat in all spheres of life.  Qaiyembu was revered greatly by her piety and gracefulness. By the guidance of Saiyedna Amiruddin saheb, Maa saahebah Qibu and Qaiyembu taught muminaat different ladies oriented skills like artistry, stitching, clothing, cooking, embroidery, mannerism, etiquette, home-making etc. with great zeal.
Maa saahebah also gave teachings regarding proper dressing-outfit and maintaining proper decency and modesty, personal hygiene to the muminaat.  She spearheaded the cause of the second marriage of a widow or divorcee and abolished the custom of Child marriage.  She was the one who began Majis e Maulaana Imaam Husain AS exclusively for ladies in Ziyaaii Masjid (sd. 1386 AH/1966 AD) during Moharram ul Haraam.
Faiji Qaiyambu was older than her brother 41st Da'i e Mutlaq Saiyedna Fakhruddin saheb AQ (d. 1347 AH/1928 AD) , hence her presence, power and prestige was witnessed in the household affairs and in the Madrasah. She herself taught a special class of young girls and prepared them for the age of puberty and helped in developing domestic skills. Saiyedna Fakhruddin saheb AQ was brought up under her loving care and she taught him Fann-e-Shaa'eri (The Art of Versification).
Each woman has to play several roles during her lifetime. It includes the role of a daughter, sister, wife, mother, daughter-in-law, sister-in-law and so on. Allaah Ta'aala has blessed every woman with innate strengths such as patience, compassion, multitasking, humility, creativity, optimism etc.  Family is protected by the outwardly intellectual strength of business and livelihood of Father and by the inwardly emotional strength of relations and home-making of Mother.  Imbalance in this creates discord and disturbances in a family.
In our Alavi Bohra community, having a girl child is considered as a Ne’mat (a blessing or bounty). A girl child is given equal importance, attention and education like any boy child. Right from her childhood, her parents make efforts for proper upbringing of their daughters . After completion of the studies from school i.e. after 12th grade, the parents motivate their daughters for further higher education in India or Abroad. The parents leave no stone unturned to make sure that their daughter gets her desired higher education.  Aqaa Maulaa Saiyedna saheb TUS always guide the parents and says, “O parents! You should engage their daughters before opting for higher education, with a boy of good and respectful character.  You will get respect through your daughters.  They will do your khidmat whenever you need your loved ones to be at your side.  Daughters will always remain close to you.  Choose a right person for them at a right time from our community only.  Freedom is good but its not meant to leave our Jamaa'at by marrying a non-Alavi.”
At the age of 18, a girl starts thinking about her career. She takes up a suitable course as per her intelligence and liking. By the grace of Allaah Ta'aala, we have many women who are, teachers, professors, doctors, engineers, nutritionist, lawyers, architects, IT professionals, dress designers, tax consultants, CS, CA, beauticians, psychologist etc.  At the age of 21, when marriage proposals start coming, the parents always consult their daughters and ask their consent. The daughter’s decision is always respected and accepted by her family. Nowadays parents permit their daughters to have a talk with a boy from whom proposal has come for engagement.  But in the past and better say the traditional way was that parents used to convey their daughters about the family of a boy and their decision.  Without any contact between a girl or boy, the decision of parents was regarded final and sublime.  The fact that parents always think better and favourable for the future of their children is eternally true.
In one of his bayaan, Aqaa Maulaa Saiyedna saheb TUS said that, “Till now we were following a tradition and has become a social norm that in order to get engaged a proposal is sent from a boy (dikro) side to a prospective girl (dikri).  But now to bestow an equal opportunity and choice for our daughters, I permit the parents of a girl to send proposal from their side to a boy if she thinks he will prove best for her.  This should be done with mutual understanding without any disrespect to our elders.  This thing is not an evil but Khayr for the integrity of our society.”
al-Hayy al-Muqaddas 44th Da'i e Mutlaq Saiyedna Taiyeb Ziyauddin saheb AQ (d. 1436 AH/2015 AD) used to do naseehat in his bayaan that, “O Muminaat! Your Ridaa is your respect and identity.  Your colourful attire is a mirror to your enterprising thoughts.  Your progress is seated on the throne of your education.  This progress is a step forward because of your unique culture.  You have to take extra care for the education of your daughters.  I want my Muminaat to be educated and always imparting education to their families.”  al-Hayy al-Muqaddas envisioned the era of English medium education.  When he was Mazoon e Mutlaq, he himself got his sister and daughter admitted to English medium school.  He strongly believed that, if anyone will not follow the need of time i.e. English learning then there is a possibility that he will miss the mainstream educational benefits.  It is due to his rigorous encouragement for higher education, today our community is enjoying its fruitful outcome of 100% literacy.
Marriage plays a crucial role in the life of every women. New relations and new responsibilities get added up in her life. Unlike other communities, we do not have the evil customs of child marriage or dowry.  In marriage, both parties give due respect to each other.  Every woman is a talented homemaker.  She is capable of managing all the responsibilities of her home and also aware of the financial condition of her family. In this competitive and expensive era, sometimes it becomes difficult for the husband to provide enough earning and support the family singlehandedly. So his wife, irrespective of her academic status, supports and takes up a suitable occupation or business to help her husband. Nowadays, we see many women are well-versed with online trading and business.  Covid era has come as a blessing in disguise as many new avenues has come to the rescue of the debt-struck family where women has started new ventures in catering, embroidery, baking, tailoring , painting etc.  Tremendous success encouraged them to continue with it from the confines of their house but only after fulfilling routine daily house chores.
Motherhood phase is one of the most challenging and charming phase in every woman’s life. During this phase she plays not only the role of a mother in her child’s upbringing and learning but simultaneously she also plays the role of a teacher, nurse, counsellor and friend. A mother is always the first teacher for her children. There is a famous proverb,  “If you educate a man you educate an individual, but if you educate a woman you educate a family (nation).” Understanding the importance of women education, our Alavi Bohra women are constant and enthusiastic learners. They are always keen to gather knowledge, whether it is Deeni or Duniyaawi. 
Every woman is the full circle. Within her is the power to create, nurture and transform. Every Alavi Bohra women is blessed since she belongs to a community where she is not bounded by any shackles but is free to take her own decisions of higher education, job, business, life partner, child-bearing, personal expenses, social involvement and responsibilities, dressings, food, religious congregations,  outings, festivities etc.  All these things are done under the holy veil of decency and dignity.  In our teaching fraternity, 70% are ladies and they are the best example to showcase the perfect balance between the family and career.  In our Deeni learning institution al-Madrasat ut-Taiyebiyah, 60% are ladies teacher where they prepare our new generation to be a perfect Mu'min and a person of good conduct.
The Saiyedaat of Da'wat e Shareefah are shouldering some of the crucial khidmaat of Jamaa'at.  Some of them are all-women committees such as,
•	al-Bunaiyaat e Taiyebiyah is organizing majaalis at various occasions. 
•	Star Charitable Trust is organizing medical camps, arranging cataract operation, best price trade exhibitions etc. 
•	at-Taiyebaat is organizing Fun-fair, sports activities, cooking and traditional recipes competition, drama and skill development competitions. 
•	Tadbeer Foundation is involved in child psychology and counselling programs, yoga and self-defence sessions. 
•	Tasheel e Nisbat works for easing and arranging the proposals of Rishtedaari-engagement to prospective boy or girl.  
•	Tanzeem e Millat e Taiyebiyah is centred on the aim to address the difficulties faced by those girls who were outsiders, but due to marriage with our jamaa'at brothers accepted our faith and they have now become a part of our society.  
•	az-Zakawi does different inspirational and educational programs for Mumbai Jamaa'at.

Dress code and Food
 	 
<br><br>

 	 
 	Wa Libaas ut-Taqwaa zaaleka Khayrun: And the Garment of Piety, that is the Best
 	 
 	The members of the Royal family which includes Da’i and his close associates, assembly members and dignitaries with special permission wear a white turban (paghdi) made of cotton cloth on a thread topi carries a distinction, unique identity and a mark of respect.  The turban of a Da’i and his deputy (ma’zoon) has a small piece of golden cloth which is evident on its front side and this distinguishes him from others.  It is worn in prayers, functions, feast, funeral, assemblies etc.  It is made only by the permission of Da’i and by the ladies (mastooraat) of Royal family at the Da’i’s residence.  Nobody can wear this turban unless permitted by Da’i.
Alavi Bohra’s traditional dress for man is white kurta, pyjama and a special cap weaved from white-silver-golden thread called topi.  He is supposed to wear this attire in religious rituals as well as social gatherings where there is a presence of Da’i or his representative, whether he be in mosque, mausoleum, graveyard or when he comes to meet someone at the Da’i’s residence.  He puts on a golden turban pheto instead of a traditional topi and an outer robe called ‘abaa or sayaa especially during the marriage ceremony. For woman, the dress code is a veil which covers her entire body from head to toe called as rida.  There is no rule of its colour or pattern, but not a single body part of chastity and modesty should get revealed to a person with whom she can marry (ghayr-mehram).  Traditional rida is made of two pieces; upper (pardi) and lower (ghaghro) stitched with beautiful laces and adorned with imitation materials.  Like man, woman is dressed in rida on all religio-social occasions or when she goes out for some work.  This dress code has now become an integral part of her social life and is coined as a unique identity of a Bohri woman.  In Madrasah Taiyebiyah, the dress code for boys is white loose long shirt (kurta), loose trouser (pyjama) and topi and for girls is white loose long frock (kurti), loose trouser (izaar) and scarf.
Alavi Bohras eat collectively in a group of 7 persons at social functions or with family members at home in a traditional big round plate known as a thaal while sitting on the floor.  Eating with spoon and fork is not permissible i.e. one has to eat with his right hand fingers and not by using left hand. Also one cannot sit and eat on table or chair with exception that one has any health problem. This is a tradition (sunnat) of the Prophet Mohammad (saws) who sat with his household i.e. Ali, Faatimah, Hasan and Husain (panjatan paak) in a big round plate and used to eat the holy dishes of the Paradise send from the Heavens.  That heavenly plate came to be known as maa’edah.   Every year during the New Year’s Eve, every Bohra’s house witnesses a specially decorated thaal with a variety of dishes made from cereals (popularly called as lachko), vegetables, fish and meat.  It is considered a good omen for a house to sit together in this thaal and begin the feast with the name of Allaah by taking salt, sugar, milk, honey etc.  When Da’i presides on any social function, his permission is first sought and a thaal is presented before him, then only other thaals are distributed between guests.  After he takes first morsel, others start eating after taking his permission.  Manners and etiquettes are maintained strictly while eating and sharing the dishes. Salt is tasted first by reciting Bismillaah after which the eldest member in the thaal eats the serving first. The thaal must be clean and free from any remaining food after eating. Each member takes the amount of serving which is sufficient for him. Wastage and excess of food is not permitted. Every member again tastes the salt at the end.   One has to sit with his legs folded backward and see that nothing falls down while taking morsels on the plastic sheet (sifrah) kept below the thaal.

Profession and Education

 	Though Vadodara, being the hometown (maadar-e-watan) for majority of Alavi Bohras, they are scattered in different parts of India and abroad.  Mumbai is another city which has sizeable number of Alavis where they have their own mosque, graveyard, community hall and guest house.  In the last 15 years, some of the families have migrated to Vadodara for social benefit and better livelihood.  They are also settled in the big cities like Surat, Ahmedabad, Pune, and Bangalore etc.  Alavi Bohras of Nadiad town have a distinction of constructing a small beautiful mosque in spite of small number of families and they always gather in it for all big occasions and support each other in every possible way.  Anand, Choota-Udaipur, Borsad, Ankleshwar, Bharuch, Navsari, Mevli, Halol, Kalol, Umalla, Godhra, Kosamba etc. also have some families doing ancestral business.  Internationally, some of the young professionals and entrepreneurs are settled with their families in US, UK, UAE, Saudi Arabia and Australia.  They all come to Vadodara along with their children and visit Da'i to get guidance and blessings.  They are well-connected and well-informed with their community through the community monthly newsletter “Mishkaat ul-Haadi” and the community website www.alavibohra.org.
Being Bohras, main occupation is manufacturing business and trading especially production and retailing of optical frames, tin containers, tin cupboards and furniture, hardware, printing, dress material, catering, industrial plant ducting, computer hardware and software etc. In fact, optical market is largely dominated by Alavi Bohras in Vadodara.  Now the trend is fast changing towards professionalism, thus the number of teachers, accountants, engineers, doctors, CAs, MBAs, advocates, computer professionals, company managers etc. is rapidly increasing.  Not following the foot-steps of their home-business, these skillful enthusiastic youngsters are opting for entirely different course of interest for fulfilling their aspirations which assures them with stable career, progress and financial strength.
To aid people financially and to promote trade and commerce, Alavi Bohras have their own Co-operative bank situated in Vadodara which was established during the time of the 43rd Da'i, Saiyedna Yusuf Nooruddin.  Today, this bank has progressed considerably and is helping needy people in carrying out their routine business smoothly.  They have several charitable trusts and social workers who help the weaker section of the community by assisting them in healthcare, hospitalization, books and fees for higher education, school and tuition fees, food, giving loans without interest (qarz-e-hasanah), providing houses with low rates, arranging finance for marriages etc.
The total population of Alavi Bohras is around 8000 people.  The ratio of male-female is normally equal and there is no discrimination of education and upbringing between a boy or girl child.  Alavi parents are very keen and serious to educate their children and give them the best for their future in form of religious and professional education.  There is a strong instinct of learning tradition amongst the Alavi Bohras, their Da'is usually being prolific writers, orators and promoters of education.  Today all the young members of the Royal Family i.e. the household of Da’i which is the first family of the community are well-educated and well-aware of social traits and trends.  It was a wish of the present Da’i (Saiyedna) to see his community with the priceless wealth of higher education.  And now this has became a reality,   with the persistent and untiring efforts of spreading the awareness of acquiring knowledge His Holiness Abu Haatim Saiyedna Taiyeb Ziyauddin (tus) has accomplished his mission and achieved the goal of attaining nearly 100% literacy rate in the community.  Importance of imparting education to the children is always focused in the discourses and sermons by Saiyedna.  Not a single child in the community is deprived of basic education. This awareness has transformed the way of living drastically. Apart from taking interest in the family business, the youngsters have started opting for higher studies in various disciplines to carve out their bright future.
Saiyedna ascended on the holy throne of Da’wat (takht-e-taiyebi) in 1394 AH/1974 AD, and since then he has led the tenure of his Da'iship by guiding and guarding believers on the right path (siraat-e-mustaqeem)and the way of salvation (raah-e-najaat).  Knowing that treading on this path without education will not get the community its desired destination (manzil-e-madqsood), a preliminary school (baalwadi) which was founded during the time of the 43rd Da'i, Saiyedna Yusuf Nooruddin, in Badri Mohalla, was shifted to a new premises now called as Zenith School.  This educational institution has helped to a large extent in building the educational awareness and in promoting higher learning among Alavi youth.

19 Jumaadi ul-Ulaa 1438 - 15-2-2017

 	On Wednesday, 19 Jumaadi ul Ulaa 1438, 15-2-2017, Patel Industrial Estate was abuzz with the preparations in the morning and all mumineen there, were enthusiastic and eager to Welcome Aqaa Maulaa Saiyedna saheb (tus).  In between the machine-power and man-power Aqaa Maulaa visited nearly 20 factories where mumineen are having Manufacturing unit in different items and goods.  Aqaa Maulaa appreciated everyone’s work and skillfulness.  He minutely observed the technicality and mechanical process through which an Item goes and lastly made into a Finished Product.  It included Cupboards, Optical Frames, Kulfi Boards and Case, Hardware Items, Chemicals, Drum Boxes, Metal Ducts for Cooling, Paper Boxes, Electro-plating etc.
In each factory, Aqaa Maulaa bestowed mumineen with Ta’weez Frame of Rozi and Barakaat, Tabarrukaat and Kalemaat of Du’aa.  Maulaa made a point to do specific Hidaayat to all factory owners where he visited.  He said that, “O Mumineen! Your Skill is a great Treasure within you.  Money is the Slave of Skill.  Where Skill goes, Wealth follows.  Allaah Ta’aala had created mumineen with Acumen, Skill and Nobility.  One should be always cautious of Mumin’s cleverness.  He never leaves an opportunity wherein he finds even a bit of return.”
“There was a time when this Patel Estate had more than 80 Optical Factories of our mumineen and we were virtually ruling this sector.  But because of internal feud, competition, diminishing demand and lack of vision in switching over to some other more sustainable manufacturing line or opting for advanced technology in the same field, the whole of optical line came to standstill and eventually majority of units faced a complete shutdown.  Today, there are only 7-8 Optical units in a good shape of production.  Now demand is high but Skill is missing.”
“O Mumineen! If you are handling your Ancestral Business or Factories, it is very much important for you to encourage your children to manage, develop and diversify your own business and take it to achieve new goals and scale new heights.  Their learning and studies should be related to your business in order to make it more marketable and cost-effective.  Youth is going towards easy money and cool jobs.  As business always involves risk and uncertainty in getting quick returns, educated lot is finding it difficult to handle.  But we have to give our skill to our children as a Great Treasure.  Cultivate it and you will find the Field of High Returns.”
In Shehaabi Masjid, Maulaa did Imaamat of Zohr-‘Asr and thereafter everybody took lunch in Maa’edah Aal-e-Mohammad (as).  Before leaving, Maulaa did Du’aa and said that,
“Create job for mumineen in your factories.  Keep trust in mumineen and make yourself waseelah so that Allaah Ta’aala gives Rozi to mumineen through your factories.”

Aqaa Maulaa visited Factories in Sardar Industrial Estate
18-22 Jumaadi ul-Ukhraa 1438 - 16-20 March 2017
 	 
 	 

 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 

 	 
 	In 1985, 44th Da’i e Mutlaq Saiyedna Taiyeb Ziyauddin Saheb (ra) laid the foundation of Gulistaan Apartments in after which Mumineen started purchasing plots and flats at Ajwa Road. Mumineen gradually started settling at Ajwa Road because of Masjid, Madrasah and Jamaa’at-khaana and now there are almost 2300 mumineen residing there on both sides of the road. Along with the residential requirements, need of Manufacturing Units also rose which gave boost to businesses in nearby areas and mumineen preferred starting their manufacturing ventures in Sardar Industrial Estate. At that time, mumineen were mainly indulged in the Optical and Tin industries which saw several ups and downs in the recent times forcing them to opt for ventures in new fields.
al-Maulaa al-Muqaddas Saiyedna Taiyeb Ziyauddin Saheb (ra) used to do Padhraamni-visit in the factories of mumineen during the time of Diwali which, then, marked beginning of the new financial year. Following his footsteps last week between 16-20 March 2017, 18-22 Jumaadi ul-Ukhraa 1438,  on Thursday, Saturday and Monday, Aqaa Maulaa visited 59 factories and manufacturing units of Sardar Industrial Estate doing production in varied and monopoly items.  Mumineen were very enthusiastic and energetic in explaining each and every aspect of manufacturing process in their factories.  Aqaa Maulaa personally roamed around the machines while workers were showing the stages through which raw material passes to get finished product.  Aqaa Maulaa  did the Khusoosi Du’aa for Barakat and blessed the mumineen with Ta’weez of Kifaayat.
All these 3 days right from 9:30 am till 1:30 pm mumineen waited eagerly for their turn as they for the first time experienced spiritual touch in their work place. Aqaa Maulaa said that,
“Your business is mine and your prosperity is the prosperity of the community.  Working with harmony and brotherhood is the key for Success in the business.  Going on the right path and taking right decision on the right time is the way of getting right gains.”
Aqaa Maulaa visited all types of factories be it smallest and cramped10x10 feet small unit or 100x100 feet huge work-shops.  Factories manufacturing various items included, Tin, Electroplating, Powder coating, Furniture, Flex, Metal works, Saddle works, Rubber Balloon, Plastic granules and recycling, Mesh and Gasket, Charna, Optical frames, Paper Boxes, Tin Boxes, Corrugated Drums, Heavy Machinery, Teflon works, Drum painting, Glass works, Paint tins etc.
Goals:
1.	To make association of factory owners and help those who plan to establish such units on small scale.
2.	To recruit skilled as well as unskilled workers from mumineen as per the requirement.
3.	To make young students studying SSC or above visit these factories and make them aware of manufacturing line and its development.
4.	To keep data of munineen working in these units and how can they train others and give opportunities in their respective field.
5.	To provide light work to muminaat who can do it in their houses and earn respectfully.

Vadodara City: A centre of Da’wat
 	 
 	 

 	 
 	Wa Zakariyaa iz naadaa Rabbahu, Rabbe la tazarni Fardan: And Zakariyaa, when he cried out to his Lord, O my Lord! Do not leave me without an Heir
 	 
 	Audio: Nazm of Vadodara City: "Aye Pyaare Baroda Hum Is Dil mai Basaa lenge, Aabaad Bahaaro ko Lutne se Bachaa lenge"
 	 
 	Since 1110 AH/ 1699 AD, three centuries has passed and 12 Alavi missionaries (da’is) have so far served the holy mission of Allaah with peace and prosperity.  Vadodara is the place of moderate peace-loving people with moderate climatic conditions.   Its soil has the essence of producing the men of wisdom and intellectuality.  It is a distinction for Alavi Bohras that as many as 12 missionaries with a gap of 20 years when 35th Da’i carried on the mission in Surat (1158-1178 AH/1745-1764 AD), have served their spiritual responsibilities from a single city and in a single house for such a long period.  This distinction reaches to a new level of supremacy from the fact that the foundation of the place which is now the residence of Saiyedna is more than 300 years old where all 12 da’is stayed in their respective periods of Da’wat and now it is showered by the bliss of angelic presence of these da’is. This holy residence (Devdi Mubaarak) houses in it, an unparallel and priceless treasures of Faatimi-Taiyebi literature.  It has the library of 450 Arabic and Persian manuscripts (MSS-makhtootah), some of them around 500 yrs old.
When their 32nd Da’i-e-Mutlaq Saiyedna Ziyauddin Jivabhai migrated to Vadodara, he took all the valuable manuscripts with him which was there in the possession of Alavi da’is in Ahmedabad.  In Vadodara, he first built a beautiful mosque with 7 pillars and 21 arches.  He pioneered to build a separate street (mohalla) for Alavi Bohras. He built a mosque at the entrance of mohalla and kept his residence in the middle of it.  He then meticulously preserved those manuscripts and maintained this legacy for posterity. There are also autograph copies chiefly transcribed by the Alavi missionaries (da’is) making it a unique treasure house and a rich traditional heritage. These manuscripts are mainly on Faatimi jurisprudence (fiqh), history (akhbaar), doctrines (aqaa'id), facts and realities (haqaa'iq), lectures (majaalis), succession in Prophets and their progeny with propagation of Nass, refutation of false sects, religious sciences, poetry, biographies, admonitions and prayers and on comparative studies. They all are painstakingly preserved, carefully maintained, and periodically copied by Ma’zoon-e-Mutlaq himself, who is next to Saiyedna andby his selected pupils under strict permission and supervision.  These manuscripts are not merely for the purpose of storage and preservation or to boast of this legacy, but it is regularly read, taught and literary works are carried out by translating different topics into Lisaan ud-Da’wat.  This is done carefully so as to make its complexity easier for a common Alavi to comprehend.
In Vadodara, Alavi Bohras have 4 mosques, 4 community halls, 4 mausoleums in which there are tombs (quboor) of 11 Alavi da’is. They also have a sectarian religious school named as Madrasah Taiyebiyah.    The need of a separate guest-house has not yet felt as every Alavi Bohras who stay in other cities or countries have their own house or they have their close relatives in Vadodara.  If a problem of staying arises to anyone there is a facility in the community hall, but this seldom happens.  Between the period of 1405-1420 AH/1985-2000 AD, the families who were staying in a single house in Badri Mohalla, planned to shift to a new place in a bungalow or flat as the families grew with new marriages.  Saiyedna directed these families to build new houses in one locality and named it as "Taiyebi Park" to protect Alavi culture and social relations.  During this period many families shifted to Ajwa Road and Fatehgunj in Vadodara to form new Alavi neighbourhood with mosque and madrasah.  The place (jamaa’at-khaana)where the food for lunch or dinner is prepared has a strong historical significance and spiritual attachment.  The food has a special taste and aroma which one cannot find anywhere.  This place is near the Main Mosque and was frequented by all the late Alavi da’is who had a food there and blessed the followers with heartfelt supplications (du’a).  Today Saiyedna and his assembly members sit on the same blessed place for meals of feast and funeral.

Love for India and their Relationship with Other Communities
<br><br>
 	 

 	 
 	Rabbe yassir wa laa to'assir Rabbe tammim bil Khayr: O my Lord! Ease my Work and don’t make it difficult and complete it with your graceful Hands
 	 
 	Flag Hoisting Ceremony at Badri Mohalla: Independence Day
 	 
 	After fulfilling the personal and religious commitments, the second priority of Alavi Bohras is to maintain social and national interests.  They love their country, its people and culture; abide to its law and respect its rich heritage.  It is the land of Hunaid, under whose guidance Aadam, the first prophet became the guardian of the mission of Allaah (Da’wat ul-Haqq), which was previously called as Hunaidistaan. But as the time passed the name got transformed from Hunaidistaan to “Hindustaan”. Three pieces of land are blessed by Allaah Ta’aala and His Da’wat will always remain in them – they are Hind, Sindh and Yaman. It is the land of truth and true mission.  Till the Day of Judgement, this fruitful land of holy men will remain the centre of this mission.  Alavi Bohras have maintained friendly relations with the people of their home-land India whether they are Hindus, Christians, Parsis, Sunnis, Isnaa-Asharis, Nizaris, Sulaymanis and Dawoodis.  They participate in the social functions of all the above communities, invite them for their family occasions, do trade and commerce and collectively participate to counter any anti-national or anti-social activities.  They celebrate the national festivals with their countrymen such as Republic day, Independence Day, Hindu New year, Uttarayan, Christmas etc.
It is the branches that differ; but the stem of the tree is the only source of nourishment for its branches.  Thus, Alavis and all other Taiyebi Bohras who believe in the institution of Da’i-e-Mutlaq have the only one stem of Faatemi Imaams and Du’aat of Yaman representing the holy tree (shajarah) of Panjatan Paak – The household of the Prophet Mohammad Rasoolullaah (saws).  There is no difference in their literature, tenets and ethos, but it is the branches of the line of succession of Da’is due to which they got identified with various names.Alavi Bohras have nurtured cordial relationship with their counter parts i.e. Sulaymanis and Dawoodis.  People of both the Bohras communities are attached socially and with trade and business.  In special cases, both of them accept Alavi girls in marriage and likewise Alavis can marry their son with a girl of Sulaymani or Dawoodi origin.  Once an Alavi boy or girl marries an outsider without the permission of Da’i, he/she ceases to be a member of Alavi Bohra community.  If any outsider wants to become a member of Alavi Bohra community, he should first clean himself with ritual purity, then get preliminary religious knowledge required to be a Bohra and give an oath of allegiance to the Da’i.
The members of other communities are permitted to attend the ceremony of Nikaah and its proceeding as ladies are not present in this ceremony.  A special place is allotted to these people with whom bridegroom or the guardian of a bride share cordial relationship and they request to see this ceremony closely.  They are given white dress and traditional topi to participate in it and after the ceremony Da’i gift them with a special symbol of remembrance (rumaal-itr) as a blessing.

An Ideal Healthy Life of an Alavi Bohra: He and His Environment
<br><br><br><br>
 	 

 	 
 	Wa in Ta'uddu Ne'matallaah la Tohsuha, Innallaah la-Ghafoor ur-Raheem: If you enumerate Allaah's blessings, you will not be able to count them. Indeed Allaah is all-Forgiving, all-Merciful
 	 
 	Allaah Ta’aala says in the Qur’an, ‘Then which of the Blessings (ne’mat) of your Lord will you deny?’ Leading a healthy life is a Blessing of Allaah for all of us. Health is a broad term which encompasses variety of parameters. Health does not only mean physical health. It also includes mental, social and spiritual health or wellbeing – which is called as “Health in Totality.”
Saiyedna (tus) envisages the life of Alavi mumineen and says that, “Allaah Ta’aala has done favour on us by bestowing us with life full of faith and fervor.  Health in Totality is the greatest Blessing and ne’mat of Allaah Ta’aala.  Life began from Spirituality which is the foremost dimension in our lives, which decides and governs our Physical life in this World. Everything in this Universe has been created with a purpose. It has to reach to the point of its Origin by going through the cycles of Life and Death. Life is priceless and one should recognize its worth.  We all began from the Spiritual World in the form of nafs (spirit). It is the union of nafs and body through which we execute our deeds physically.” Hence the surrounding physical factors are equally important to attain Health in Totality. Health starts from Spiritual plane to Mental; then to Physical and lastly to Social plane. Healthy Mind and Body assures that our surroundings will automatically become clean and healthy.  We should live our life and let others live their own.  Cleanliness and Purity (on all planes) are the prime factors which will lead us to success and solace.”
Health does not merely mean being free from any disease. Health is a state of harmony where the functioning of all faculties leads to productivity and positivity. Health can be divided broadly into Spiritual Health, Physical Health (which includes mental plane) and Environmental Health (which includes social plane). A man is said to be healthy only if these three things are healthy. Hence complete health is better than thousand bounties.

He who knows his Religion best is the most learned man in this World. No school, college or university can teach the Human Values better than one’s Religion. He has, indeed won the race in this World and the Hereafter, who has practiced his Religion in its purity and truthfulness.<br><br>

 	Character and Qualities of Bohras
 	 
     <br><br>

 	 
 	The word ‘Bohra' or ‘Vohra/vhora' means ‘to trade’ or ‘to do business’. It means a merchant, a businessman or a trader who does his job lawfully and justly. The Faatemi Isma'ili Da'wat established its footprints around 467 AH during the time of Imaam Mustansir Billaah (AS) at the coastline of Gujarat at Khambaat and this land of India emanated the light and the jewels of faith. Blessed by the guidance and knowledge of Maulaai Abdullaah and Maulaai Ahmad (RA), large number of people embraced the divine principles, culture and customs of Faatemi Da'wat and pledged to become a true and staunch followers of Ahl-ul-Bayt (AS). Enlightened by the light of knowledge and wisdom, all of them collectively gave misaaq (covenant) of Imaam-uz-Zamaan (AS) to his deputy in India. Trade and business was in their vein and this was the main source of income for them. This is the reason they got the name ‘Bohra' or ‘Vohra'.  They flourished in the region where heavy activities of trade and commerce were going on and the entire Gujarat long coastline had became a sort of hub for merchants across the globe.
‘Bohra' is a charming and pleasing word associated more with the social relations than mere business. Bohras are outgoing and genial in the society; amiable and affable in the family relations; kind and tactful in their business matters and undoubtedly they are more devoted and committed in religious obligations and spiritual beliefs. Allaah Ta'aala through His rightfully directed Imaam has blessed the Bohras with the precious qualities of intelligence and astuteness so that they become competent and proficient in all the worldly and religious undertakings and accomplishments, from its beginning till the end. They always start a business after considering the aspects of Halaal and Haraam in it as taught to us by our Da’i uz-Zamaan (tus). To keep their words and to accomplish the undertaken task is in their blood. The most distinguishing quality of Bohras is, they pave the way through all the odds and hardships that come in the way and seeking the help of Allaah they achieve their goal.
The name of Bohra has gained an outstanding identity, credit and fame in the world of business and trade that even a dishonoured and incapable person gets a lift up with this magical, soothing and influential word “Bohras”. As a guide is, so are the people guided; as a teacher is, so are his students; as a leader is, so are his followers. The character, conduct, conversation and discipline of Bohras itself reflect the firm religious administration, deliverance of systemic education and quality of trade relations. They feel that, “We are respected if we respect others; we sow what we reap; we get what we give.” From these words of wisdom one can get an idea that not only in the worldly matters but even in religious duties and in seeking the blessings and bounties of Allaah, the Bohras lead all other communities.
Rasoolullah (saws) says in his Hadees-e-Shareef, “One who completes Wuzoo (ablution), has interest in Namaaz (prayer), gives the Zakaat of his wealth to his Da’i, controls his anger, thinks before speaking, spends on good things and leave unlawful things, seeks salvation from Allaah, follows the advices of Ahl-ul-Bayt (as) by remaining faithful and loyal to them from his heart will gain the honour that the doors of Paradise will be open for him.” This Hadees has eight orders in it. The first three of them are from the pillars of Islaam which are obligatory and the next four are important for Believers to obey in order to maintain self-respect. The last order is the most important of all and is obligatory without which all others are nullified. This order is the blend and concoction of all seven orders and it is the supreme and greatest of all.  These are the facts of faith (Haqaa’iq ul-Imaan) which every Bohra regard as a core to lead a successful life, here and hereafter.  All other deeds don’t carry any worth without following these facts.  The last order has very broad meaning in which the oath of allegiance (bay’at) to the Da’i is the foremost to reach to the devotion of Ahl ul-Bayt (as).
Truly, he is not a true a faithful who does not abide to the previous eight orders of seeking the favor of Paradise blessed by Allaah. The reward of Paradise is a surety for the one who conforms to these eight commandments. This reward is the greatest victory, advantageous issue and profitable trade for the one who abide to it. Allaah Ta'aala has written Paradise in reward by purchasing the soul and wealth of a faithful. This is the real righteous divine business over-spilling with the gems of wisdom and pearls of piety.
If Allaah Ta'aala rewards us with Paradise in return of our soul and wealth by making us Bohras then we have to beautify and purify our soul and wealth before giving it to Allaah; only then the divine deal is profitable or else it will run in loss. We pray Allaah to accord us with His divine guidance so that we are successful in the deals of this world and are blessed with the favor of Paradise by character and deeds of being Bohras under the dominion and headship of Aaqaa Maulaa Huzoor-e-‘Aali (tus) who is our divine father and spiritual doctor.

 	Language plays an unprecedented role in identifying the cultural and moral values of a community.  It is the foremost tool with which a community makes its presence in the society for its education and learning.  Our language i.e. Lisaan ud Da’wat or the language of Islaamic Mission has a unique and interesting account of its phase-wise development which began since 10 centuries.  The journey of our language began with the purity of Classical Arabic which is well preserved in Qur’an-e-Hakeem, Sayings of Rasoolullaah (saws), admonitions of Maulaana Ali (as) and lectures of A’immat and Du’aat (sa).  Around 468 AH, it was the time of the 18th Faatemi Imaam Maulaana al-Mustansir Billaah (as) in Egypt when our missionaries came to India to preach our faith to the people who were totally unaware of Arabic.  Thus there rose a need to learn local Indian language for the missionaries and mix it with Arabic terminology to teach the people more effectively.
This marked the commencement of the new phase of Da’wat language which our missionaries or Du’aat handled with great care and distinctiveness.  During the Da’wat in Yaman, our representatives (Maulaayis) in India used to go to Yaman and attend the lectures of Du’aat to learn the language in its original sense and soul.  Thus the language got treated by our Maulaayis in two ways, the language for higher-ups and the language for the beginners or commonalty.  Those who were very close to the affairs of Da’wat were well-versed with Arabic and the rest knew it mixed with different dialects and phrases.  Whenever necessary, Maulaayis used to preach either in Arabic in special classes or in other tongue among masses as per their grasping power and intellectuality.
Today the same trend is prevalent, when a person having utmost knowledge of Da’wat principles and ethos bears the privilege to know the intricacies of the language.  But, we as an Alavi Bohras enjoy the favor from our Da’wat-e-Haadiyah that our Maulaa constantly emphasizes us to learn Lisaan ud Da’wat and untiring efforts have been undertaken to make it the language of every Alavi household. 
A part of this effort got a fruitful result when Sister Asma Barodawala (Attarwala) was invited for a 3 day seminar on LINGUISTIC AND LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT IN JAMMU AND KASHMIR WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO TRIBAL LANGUAGES jointly organized by Dept. of Linguistics (University of Kashmir), Central Institute of Indian Languages (Mysore) & Urdu Teaching and Research Centre (Lucknow) on 14-16 November 2011. She presented a paper on “ALAVI BOHRA LANGUAGE: LANGUAGES IN CONTACT”.  There people appreciated the paper and many of the them came to know about Alavi Bohras and their language “Lisaan ud-Da’wat”. They came to know that Alavi Bohras is a different community and independent entity existing in Baroda, Gujarat having its 44th Spiritual Head in the line of Succession from Yaman. They also awarded the paper as one of the best paper of the Seminar.
